Any skill on a ticket was treated as required until a <a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4828787357210#topic_ag5_tlr_wbc\">skills timeout</a> occurred. After that point, none of the skills remained in consideration when routing a ticket to an agent.</p>\n<p>Now, skills added by ticket triggers can be configured as either <strong>required</strong> or <strong>optional</strong>. Required skills are skills an agent absolutely must have, while optional skills are nice-to-have and subject to the skills timeout in your omnichannel routing configuration. When a skills timeout occurs and a ticket has both required and optional skills, only the optional skills are dropped from consideration. The required skills are preserved as routing criteria for the ticket, so omnichannel routing will continue to wait for an agent with all of the required skills to become available. </p>\n<p>It's important to note that if you don't configure a skills timeout, all skills are treated as required, regardless of how they're designated in the trigger action that added them.</p>\n<p>For more information, see:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/5833458075930\">Adding and managing skills on tickets</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/5833468891674#topic_d2l_bnx_txb\">About using skills to route tickets</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4828787357210\">Managing your omnichannel routing configuration</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408893545882\">Ticket trigger conditions and actions reference</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"h_01GD3S9GD63FPDGQSEFY88M3ND\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Why is Zendesk making this change?</span></h2>\n<p>We recognize that many customers need to differentiate between skills that are required for a ticket to be successfully and efficiently solved by an agent and skills that are convenient but less critical. Adding this granularity to the skills timeout functionality gives admins more control over how work is routed to agents.</p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01GD3S9TSPXM7M4WHYKYF4E84M\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What do I need to do?</span></h2>\n<p>To begin using this enhancement, make sure you've configured a <a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4828787357210#topic_ag5_tlr_wbc\">skills timeout</a> for omnichannel routing. Then create or update ticket triggers with the <a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408893545882\">add skills or set skills actions</a> and specify whether each skill is required or optional.</p>\n<p>If you have feedback or questions related to this announcement, visit our <a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/community/topics\">community forum</a> where we collect and manage customer product feedback.

Here are some reasons for this issue:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Session interruption: Refreshing the browser breaks the session with the Talk server. This interruption disconnects ongoing calls</li>\n<li>Re-initialization: When you refresh, the browser has to reload resources and re-establish connections. The active call can't be maintained during this process and gets disconnected</li>\n<li>Client-side handling: Talk relies on the client-side application to manage call connections. Refreshing the browser resets the client application, terminating active calls</li>\n<li>WebRTC connection: Talk uses WebRTC (Web Real-Time Communication) for voice calls. Refreshing the browser disrupts the WebRTC connection, causing the call to drop</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>To avoid call disconnections due to browser refreshes</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Avoid refreshing the browser while on a call.</li>\n<li>Open Zendesk in a different window for actions that may require a refresh to avoid affecting the call.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For more information, see these articles:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408829651738-How-can-I-troubleshoot-Talk-issues\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">How can I troubleshoot Talk issues?</a> </li>\n<li><a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408831417498-Talk-network-requirements\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Talk network requirements</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408827413146-What-are-the-most-common-Talk-error-messages\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">What are the most common Talk error messages?</a></li>\n</ul>",

This new API marks the beginning of a phased transition towards replacing the current HC API with a more refined and sophisticated API landscape.</p>\n<p>With the Public API for Media, developers can programmatically manage media resources through a centralized Guide Media Library, a repository designed to handle all media files at the account level.</p>\n<p>Core functionalities include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Create Media: Upload new images and article attachments to the media library with relevant metadata.</li>\n<li>Read Media: Retrieve and view media files and their details.</li>\n<li>Update Media:\n<ul>\n<li>Renaming Media: Update the names of images and article attachments.</li>\n<li>Replacing Media: Replace existing media in all their placements.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Delete Media: Remove outdated or unnecessary media to keep the repository clean.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"h_01GD3S9GD63FPDGQSEFY88M3ND\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Why is Zendesk making this change?</span></h2>\n<p>The Public API for media management is essential for maintaining consistency and branding across various projects. It simplifies media management by offering a centralized repository for monitoring and overseeing all media files. This update will boost efficiency in updating and maintaining media content and foster improved collaboration by providing shared access to media resources. Ultimately, this transition to the new API will empower developers with superior external integration capabilities, paving the way for a more refined and sophisticated API landscape, gradually phasing out the current HC API.</p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01GD3S9TSPXM7M4WHYKYF4E84M\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What do I need to do?</span></h2>\n<p>Customers using the current HC API for media management will need to transition to the new Public API for Media to take advantage of its enhanced functionalities and capabilities. Developers should review <a href=\"https://developer.zendesk.com/api-reference/help_center/help-center-api/guide_medias/\">Guide Medias</a> in the developer documentation to understand how to interact with the new API and make necessary adjustments to their integrations.</p>\n<p>If you have feedback or questions related to this announcement, visit our <a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/community/topics\">community forum</a> where we collect and manage customer product feedback.
