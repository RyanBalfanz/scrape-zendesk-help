As a service provider to other businesses, we allow and expect our Subscribers to engage in content moderation in line with the <a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408821635610\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Zendesk User Content and Conduct Policy</a>, and their own policies.</p>\n<p>Zendesk uses automated tools to identify and/or filter certain content. These tools are primarily used in the spam context – emails sent to Zendesk customer accounts are run through email spam filters and the spam verdict is used to determine whether incoming emails create tickets or are held in a review queue for customers to review. In addition, comments made on <a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408821635610\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Help Center</a> articles, as well as posts and comments in our <a href=\"https://www.zendesk.com/it/help-center/community-software/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Community</a> product are run through an automated spam filter to detect obvious spam. Zendesk also leverages automated tools to identify and suspend fraudulent accounts by looking at indicators of fraud.</p>\n<p>Zendesk does engage in reactive content moderation upon receiving notice from legal authorities, through reports submitted by members of the public, or through escalations that occur internally. Our content moderation activities are aimed to align with the <a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408821635610\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Zendesk User Content and Conduct Policy</a>, and are conducted by a centralized team within Zendesk of abuse analysts tasked with addressing abuse on Zendesk. This team receives general training upon hire, as well as periodic training on Digital Services Act compliance.</p>\n<p>Content moderation primarily consists of terminating customer accounts, which effectively removes the content, but may also consist of removing the offending content.</p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01JM1059DRPFYXX2B0ZQMJDRSQ\">Zendesk-initiated content moderation by reason</h2>\n<table style=\"border-collapse: collapse; width: 75%;\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 50%;\"><strong>Reason</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 50%;\"><strong>Number</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 50%;\">Spam/phishing</td>\n<td style=\"width: 50%;\">803</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2 id=\"h_01JM109DTCAK9YW3FEBAFQAH67\">Detection methods used</h2>\n<table style=\"border-collapse: collapse; width: 75%;\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 50%;\"><strong>Detection methods</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 50%;\"><strong>Number</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 50%;\">AI detection tool</td>\n<td style=\"width: 50%;\">340</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 50%;\">Abuse analyst observations</td>\n<td style=\"width: 50%;\">463</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h1 id=\"h_01JM10C07YC9D333DT122PVBPZ\">Appeals for redress from affected service recipients</h1>\n<table style=\"border-collapse: collapse; width: 75%;\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 50%;\">Number of complaints received through internal complaint-handling systems</td>\n<td style=\"width: 50%;\">0</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>",

A new Reviews section will replace Scorecards under Account Settings.\n<p><img src=\"https://zen-marketing-documentation.s3.amazonaws.com/docs/en/zqa_settings_review.png\" width=\"800\"></p>\n<p>Here, Admins and Account Managers can seamlessly copy and transfer scorecards and categories, mark scorecards as active or inactive, and use them across multiple workspaces without duplication. You can also rename or delete scorecards without disrupting existing workflows.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Category management at the account level</strong>: For better consistency, category creation and management will also move to the account level.\n<p><img src=\"https://zen-marketing-documentation.s3.amazonaws.com/docs/en/zqa_reviews_category_settings.png\" width=\"800\"></p>\n<p>You can add and manage exemptions and exact text matches for categories and custom AutoQA categories. Admins and Account Managers can create and reuse categories across workspaces and manage exemption lists from a single location. </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Improved Category features</strong>: All categories will be conditional by default, with 'Show always' as the standard setting. Category grouping and weighting is improved, offering a more intuitive organization and streamlined logic. You can ensure quality scores accurately reflect your criteria by applying weights to your most important categories using the new 100-point weighing scale. In the new Advanced Scorecards system, category weight values will now be represented as integers ranging from 0 to 100. This change replaces the previous use of decimal points.<br>\n<p><img src=\"https://zen-marketing-documentation.s3.amazonaws.com/docs/en/zqa_create_scorecard.png\" width=\"700\"></p>\n<p>Admins and Account Managers can assign category criticality at the category/group level for clearer failure logic. Fail the entire ticket for major mistakes or only a specific category group for issues needing attention, without impacting overall ticket quality. Gain insights into topics that may not apply universally by adding non-scoring categories. Root causes can now be applied to all scores, including positive ones. Additionally, individual categories can be marked as N/A without impacting performance scores.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"h_01GD3S9GD63FPDGQSEFY88M3ND\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Why is Zendesk making this change?</span></h2>\n<p>This update makes scorecard management more scalable, intuitive, and impactful— allowing you to focus more on insights and driving quality, and less on manual adjustments.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It reduces duplicate work by consolidating redundant scorecards and categories for easier management.</li>\n<li>With a more intuitive setup, editing, and testing process, we’ve minimized manual effort and simplified the user experience, so you can easily modify or remove scorecards without affecting workflows.</li>\n<li>It also enhances transparency in how categories impact scores by clarifying the scoring logic and category relationships.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"h_01GD3S9TSPXM7M4WHYKYF4E84M\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What do I need to do?</span></h2>\n<p>Workspace Managers will lose access to scorecard management, as this will no longer be managed at the workspace level. Only Admins and Account Managers will have this capability. To retain access, Workspace Managers must be upgraded to Admin level.

Statuses help users report and filter conversation logs to assess the effectiveness of AI agents. A conversation's status may change throughout the session based on the dialogue and is recalculated with each visitor interaction.</p>\n<p>After a session ends, the conversation status is updated to its final state. The end of a session depends on the type of bot used:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>For ticket bots, sessions end after 72 hours</li>\n<li>For chat bots, the session duration depends on the CRM platform.

Therefore, the logic is different. While the original email may show the support address in the CC field, the Zendesk UI moves this address to the To field to indicate which support address the email was sent to.</p>\n<p>Additionally, recipients are moved to the CC field. This lets agents know who their response will be sent back to, and agents can ensure all recipients are included in the email. The same happens in a ticket where the inbound email is sent to any external email address, and the subdomain support email address is CCed.

The new implementation failed to correctly handle NULL values, leading the system to incorrectly identify users as suspended.

This behavior happens when a specific task is assigned and when agents are either working or taking a break.</p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01JJM8B0D4NKE9QQBKP49ZW1N1\">Answer</h2>\n<p>This behavior is expected when the computer experiences a loss of connectivity, such as going offline, entering sleep mode, or being disconnected from the internet for a certain duration. The system automatically updates the task status to <strong>Offline</strong> due to network inactivity.</p>\n<p>To mitigate this situation and maintain the status of ongoing tasks, agents can utilize the task lock feature. This feature allows them to lock the task they are currently engaged in when they anticipate that their computer might lose its active internet connection or when there is a lack of activity.</p>\n<p>By locking the task, agents can ensure that their progress is preserved, and the task will not be automatically switched to <strong>Offline</strong> status, allowing for a smoother workflow and minimizing disruptions.</p>\n<p>For further details on how to implement the task lock feature, refer to these articles:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/6443329357210-Activating-task-lock\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Activating task lock</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/6443329257114-Using-task-lock\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Using task lock</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>",
