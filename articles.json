However, I've noticed that the number of solved and closed tickets displayed can sometimes differ depending on the user, and it does not match the requester's actual solved tickets. Can you explain why this happens?</p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01HYBAYSYEBM197897FQ8P2KW9\">Answer</h2>\n<p>The difference in the number of solved and closed tickets is due to how the app handles archived tickets based on the number of tickets a user has.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Users with less than 100 tickets: The app excludes archived, solved, and closed tickets from the count. This means that the displayed numbers only reflect tickets that are not archived.</li>\n<li>Users with 100 or more tickets: The app includes archived, solved, and closed tickets in the count. Thus, the numbers shown include all tickets, both active and archived.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The app is designed this way to optimize performance and minimize load on our platform. By excluding archived tickets for users with fewer tickets, the app ensures faster data retrieval and reduces unnecessary processing. For users with a larger volume of tickets, including archived tickets ensures comprehensive data representation without significantly impacting performance.</p>\n<p>For more information about ticket archiving, see the article: <a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408887617050-About-ticket-archiving\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">About ticket archiving</a>.</p>",

This impacts customers who have migrated to the Omnichannel Backend Routing. In order to ensure your agent's names are sent in chat and messaging with only their intended alias you will need to perform the following actions: 1. Set a Support alias in addition to your Chat display name 2. Update Chat shortcuts to not use {{agent_name}} Our teams are reviewing this behavior and we will provide further updates as they become available.

Due to this conflict, the current user who tries to log in via JWT authentication can't be authenticated.</p>\n<p>For example, this error can occur when an existing Zendesk user with an external_ID 1234 was updated and the <code>external_ID</code> of the user changed, for example 123456. Both the user in Zendesk and the payload will have the same information, same email, and same external_ID. When trying to authenticate the user however, the email registered for that user will be linked to an <code>AppUserID</code> in Sunshine Conversation. Zendesk will only allow the authentication of the user with the previous external_ID, 1234.</p>\n<p>To resolve this behaviour and allow users with an updated <code>external_ID</code> to log in via JWT authentication, you must delete the previous <code>AppUserID</code> linked to the first <code>external_ID</code>.</p>\n<p>With Suite Professional and above plans, make an API call:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Basic authentication</strong>, use an <a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4576088682266-Using-the-Conversations-API-keys#:~:text=To%20create%20and%20share%20an,Click%20Create%20API%20key.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">API key and a secret key</a>.\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Username</strong>: <code>API_KEY_ID</code>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Password</strong>: <code>API_KEY_SECRET</code>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>API method</strong>: <code>DELETE</code>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>URL for European accounts</strong>: <code>https://api.eu-1.smooch.io/v2/apps/{appId}/users/{userIdOrExternalId}</code>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>URL for the rest of the world</strong>: <code>https://api.smooch.io/v2/apps/{appId}/users/{userIdOrExternalId}</code><br>Within the above URLs, replace the <code>{appId}</code> with the ID provided when generating the API key and secret key, and replace the <code>{userIdOrExternalId}</code> with the previous <code>external_ID</code> linked to the user who returns the error.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"p\">\n<div class=\"note note\">\n<span class=\"notetitle\"><strong>Disclaimer</strong>:</span> This article is provided for instructional purposes only.

Once the issue was identified, we reverted the change, restoring normal service.</p>\n<div id=\"message-list\">\n<h4 id=\"h_01J2DR6JA2R8R1HDQ4KDEFNF1S\" class=\"undefined\"><strong>Timeline<br></strong></h4>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>July 05, 2024 01:52 PM UTC | July 05, 2024 06:52 AM PT<br></strong>Changes were successfully reverted to the previous working state.

Specifically, a setting was altered that directed our service to an incorrect storage location, resulting in errors when trying to save call recordings.</p>\n<h4 id=\"h_01J2DR3R7PPAJVYF5N237D1H65\"><strong>Resolution</strong></h4>\n<p>Upon identifying the issue, we quickly reverted the change that caused the problem. This rollback restored the correct configuration, and our service resumed normal operation.</p>\n<h4 id=\"h_01J2DR3V87XN0SBMBJ3HJNK8B5\"><strong>Remediation</strong></h4>\n<p>To prevent this from happening again, we are taking the following steps:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Improved Testing: We will enhance our testing processes to catch similar issues before they reach production.</li>\n<li>Configuration Management: We will update our system to use separate settings for different services, ensuring that changes to one service do not inadvertently impact another.</li>\n<li>Monitoring and Alerts: We will improve our monitoring and alerting systems to detect and respond to issues more quickly.</li>\n</ol>\n<h4 id=\"h_01J2CDA4B7BNCA6EZZPHNVQ2D2\"><strong><br>FOR MORE INFORMATION</strong></h4>\n<p class=\"p1\">For current system status information about your Zendesk, check out our <a href=\"https://status.zendesk.com\">system status page</a>.

Common explanations include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your provider settings: Some providers replace the original caller number with the forwarding number or another default number.</li>\n<li>Possible provider limitations with the caller ID passthrough: When forwarding calls, not all telephony providers support passing through the original caller ID. This is often due to network limitations or policies aimed at preventing spoofing.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To find a solution, reach out to the provider of your forwarding phone number. They can check their policies, settings, and capabilities regarding forwarded calls.</p>\n<p>For more information on Talk, see this article: <a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408827987482-Preparing-to-use-Talk\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Preparing to use Talk</a>.</p>",

We took immediate action to manage the increased load and restore normal operations.</p>\n<h4 id=\"h_01J2DSD18VCCNM90XD0WZMBGCB\"><strong>Root Cause Analysis</strong></h4>\n<p>The main cause was a sudden traffic spike, which doubled our usual traffic and saturated our database, leading to delays. Additionally, our AnswerBot service couldn't handle the increased load, causing further disruptions.</p>\n<h4 id=\"h_01J2DSD51H30SSZ9GE3XN6QSRR\"><strong>Resolution</strong></h4>\n<p>To mitigate the issue, we scaled up our database and AnswerBot service, increasing their capacity to handle the surge. This allowed us to restore normal operations and process the backlog of messages.</p>\n<h4 id=\"h_01J2DSD8K47SZQWP2BHMBZJ30S\"><strong>Remediation Items</strong></h4>\n<p>1. Enable Auto-Scaling: Implement automatic scaling for critical services to handle sudden traffic spikes.<br>2. Introduce Circuit Breakers: Prevent overloading of services by temporarily reducing traffic when necessary.<br>3. Improve Monitoring: Enhance our monitoring systems to detect and respond to similar issues more quickly.<br><br></p>\n<h4 id=\"h_01J1W1JCEC1J8X6J4KGSB0C8SR\"><strong>FOR MORE INFORMATION</strong></h4>\n<p class=\"p1\">For current system status information about your Zendesk, check out our <a href=\"https://status.zendesk.com\">system status page</a>.

Check below for the possible causes and how to resolve them.</p>\n<h3 id=\"h_01J1TQRJ8VB5D5HM9X2N7TM908\">Emails are in your suspended tickets queue</h3>\n<p>Check your suspended tickets queue for the missing emails. There are several <a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408828416282-Causes-for-ticket-suspension\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">causes of ticket suspension</a> which can impact the ability for an email to create a ticket, such as the use of email for bulk ticket creation instead of the API and channels framework.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>When a ticket is suspended it also can cause a discrepancy in the creation date timestamp. If an email is recovered from your suspended tickets queue, the creation date will match when the ticket was recovered rather than when the email was originally received.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"h_01J1TQRR5YXH46P58B0A14BJ47\">An active service incident is impacting email delivery or ticket creation</h3>\n<p>On rare occasions a service incident can prevent the creation of tickets through email. Check for an active service incident on Zendesk's <a href=\"https://status.zendesk.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">status page</a> for emails not creating tickets.</p>\n<h3 id=\"h_01J1TRX6X9T4PQQ600AHJX1YKM\">You use Gmail and your connection from Google to Zendesk was interrupted</h3>\n<p>If you use the Gmail connector and do not see emails creating tickets, check the status of your <a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/5279521301914-Managing-your-support-addresses\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">support address</a>.
