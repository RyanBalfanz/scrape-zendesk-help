You'll now experience better precision in similar ticket recommendations, along with more recommendations overall.<br>This announcement includes the following topics:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#h_01JAWXJ2GB1VH0RTAB79SFCGAM\">What’s changing?</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#h_01JAWXJFXG821CKH748RAP10Z6\">Why is Zendesk making this change?</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#h_01JAWXJMP4382CP8913FAZFWRJ\">What do I need to do?</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"h_01JAWXJ2GB1VH0RTAB79SFCGAM\">What's changing?</h2>\n<p>The similar tickets feature, currently in an early access program (EAP), has already garnered strong interest. The improvements in the recommendations' precision and the increase in overall number of recommendations were achieved by leveraging generative AI. We believe it will greatly enhance this feature's usefulness and adoption.</p>\n<p>Additionally, we've made the similar tickets feature available to more customers by removing the requirement to have the <a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4550640560538#topic_gpp_p4g_htb\">intent prediction type turned on</a>. This means that all customers with the <a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/5524125586330\">Advanced AI add-on</a> can now benefit from similar tickets without any extra setup.</p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01JAWXJFXG821CKH748RAP10Z6\">Why is Zendesk making this change?</h2>\n<p>Based on your feedback, we recognized two key areas needing improvement: the precision and availability of similar ticket recommendations. You often noticed similar tickets existed but weren't seeing enough of them. When they did appear, they sometimes weren't useful due to the complexity and unstructured nature of the ticket content.</p>\n<p>These enhancements are designed to support all agents across a wide range of tickets, from the simplest to the most complex, as well as from the most frequent to the rarest cases. Ultimately, we expect them to boost efficiency, reduce resolution times, and improve customer satisfaction.</p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01JAWXJMP4382CP8913FAZFWRJ\">What do I need to do?</h2>\n<p>If you've already <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScjMd9__L7RXEtZvS9IQLQz_3--OOZxam2FsIh2BX72lraFTA/viewform\">signed up for the similar tickets EAP</a> and <a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/8036381366426\">turned similar tickets on</a>, then no further action is necessary. This change will be automatically available after the rollout ends on October 28.</p>\n<p>If you have the Advanced AI add-on but haven't yet signed up for the EAP, you can <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScjMd9__L7RXEtZvS9IQLQz_3--OOZxam2FsIh2BX72lraFTA/viewform\">sign up for the EAP here</a>. For more information on using the feature, see <a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/6154115110170\">Finding tickets similar to the current ticket (EAP)</a>.</p>\n<p>If you’re interested in the Advanced AI add-on, see <a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/5715517808026-Buying-the-Advanced-AI-add-on\">Buying the Advanced AI add-on</a> or contact your Zendesk account representative.</p>\n<p>If you have feedback or questions related to this announcement, visit our <a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/community/topics/6447052855194\">community forum</a> where we collect and manage customer product feedback.

When you turn on multi-conversations, authenticating an end user after starting a messaging conversation still merges them with the authenticated user profile.

One reason is that the system may take time to update and reflect the available space.</p>\n<p>Not all tickets have attachments, so deleting those with few or none don't significantly free up space allocated to your files. To manage storage, look for tickets with large attachments, as deleting them will free up more space.</p>\n<p>For more information, read the article: <a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408885871130-How-can-I-remove-attachments-from-tickets\">How can I remove attachments from tickets?</a></p>",

This ensures that users do not encounter 404 errors when accessing outdated links. The API supports three primary use cases:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Redirecting Deleted Objects</strong>: If a help center article or section is removed, you can redirect the old URL to a new article or section. This avoids 404 errors and maintains SEO relevance.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Redirecting Previous URLs During Migration</strong>: If you're transferring content from a non-Zendesk platform but keeping the same subdomain, you can redirect the former URLs to the new Zendesk URLs. This preserves SEO for both users and search engine crawlers.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Redirecting Vanity URLs or Other Patterns</strong>: Establish vanity URLs or different patterns within your Zendesk subdomain or a host-mapped subdomain. This process involves creating shorter URLs that lead users directly to articles or custom pages.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"h_01J9M2JKGYDKBN0SZQSYVFS4KW\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Why is Zendesk making this change?</span></h2>\n<p>This API is designed to enhance user experience by avoiding broken links and ensuring continuous access to content, even after objects are deleted.

Here are some steps to get started:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://developer.zendesk.com/api-reference/help_center/help-center-api/redirect_rules/\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\" style=\"color: #1155cc;\">Explore the API Documentation</span></a>: Familiarize yourself with the Redirect Rules API by reviewing the official API documentation to understand the available endpoints and data structures.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Set Up Redirect Rules</strong>: Begin creating redirect rules for any deleted objects or URLs that need to be redirected. Use the provided JSON format to structure your redirect rules.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Test and Validate</strong>: Ensure that your redirects are functioning correctly by testing the old URLs to confirm they lead to the new destinations.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you have feedback or questions related to this announcement, visit our <a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/community/topics\">community forum</a> where we collect and manage customer product feedback.
