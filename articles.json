With this we are marking this service incident as resolved. We thank you for your patience while we worked to resolve this.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>August 29, 2024 10:07 AM UTC | August 29, 2024 03:07 AM PT </strong><br>We are starting to see recovery for customers in both Chat and Explore. We will continue to monitor the services until full resolution.

Chat agents that are already logged in will be able to continue to chat, but the transcription will be delayed and chats will not show in the history. Any settings changed in Chat during this incident will not take effect on the affected Pods.  We will provide another update in 30 mins or when we have more information to share.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>August 29, 2024 09:14 AM UTC | August 29, 2024 02:14 AM PT </strong><br>We are currently investigating multiple issues with Chat for customers on Pods 13, 20, and 25.

Customers will either need to migrate to the <a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408845965210\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Authorization Code Flow</a> grant type or API tokens. Starting today, anyone wanting to use OAuth 2.0 for authenticating API calls can only use the Authorization Code Flow grant type.</p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01GD3S9GD63FPDGQSEFY88M3ND\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Why is Zendesk making this change?</span></h2>\n<p>In line with OAuth 2.0 best practices, the Implicit grant and the Resource Owner Password Credentials (Password) grant are now considered insecure and disallowed by the <a href=\"https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-oauth-security-topics\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">OAuth 2.0 Security Best Current Practice</a>.</p>\n<p>The Implicit grant used to be recommended because it directly returned the access token without needing an extra authorization code step. This was required for Public OAuth clients that could not securely store the <em>client_secret</em>. This method is now discouraged due to security risks, as it sends access tokens via HTTP redirects without client confirmation. It has been replaced with the more secure Authorization Code Grant with Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE). The Password grant is an outdated method for obtaining an access token by using a user's credentials. This method is now discouraged because it requires the client application to handle the user's password and send it to the authorization server, which results in an increased attack surface. It is also not compatible with two-factor authentication.</p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01GD3S9TSPXM7M4WHYKYF4E84M\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What do I need to do?</span></h2>\n<p>If you’re currently using Implicit grant or Password grant, we have emailed you separately about what your next steps are.</p>\n<p>If you’re currently using Implicit grant, you will need to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Update your current call to the <code class=\"ph codeph\">/oauth/authorizations/new</code> endpoint to use <code class=\"ph codeph\">response_type: code</code> instead of <code class=\"ph codeph\">response_type: token</code> and include the <code class=\"ph codeph\">redirect_uri</code> and <code class=\"ph codeph\">state</code> params if not already present.

Here are some reasons for this issue:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Session interruption: Refreshing the browser breaks the session with the Talk server. This interruption disconnects ongoing calls</li>\n<li>Re-initialization: When you refresh, the browser has to reload resources and re-establish connections. The active call can't be maintained during this process and gets disconnected</li>\n<li>Client-side handling: Talk relies on the client-side application to manage call connections. Refreshing the browser resets the client application, terminating active calls</li>\n<li>WebRTC connection: Talk uses WebRTC (Web Real-Time Communication) for voice calls. Refreshing the browser disrupts the WebRTC connection, causing the call to drop</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>To avoid call disconnections due to browser refreshes</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Avoid refreshing the browser while on a call.</li>\n<li>Open Zendesk in a different window for actions that may require a refresh to avoid affecting the call.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For more information, see these articles:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408829651738-How-can-I-troubleshoot-Talk-issues\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">How can I troubleshoot Talk issues?</a> </li>\n<li><a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408831417498-Talk-network-requirements\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Talk network requirements</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408827413146-What-are-the-most-common-Talk-error-messages\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">What are the most common Talk error messages?</a></li>\n</ul>",

Once you know which topics are necessary to proactively help\n                your customers, you can develop or enhance knowledge base articles to provide the\n                missing information. For example, you can analyze your tickets to find:<ul class=\"ul\" id=\"topic_ixv_zbn_lcc__ul_en2_dgn_lcc\">\n<li class=\"li\">Common issues or pain points that users struggle with</li>\n<li class=\"li\">Frequently asked questions</li>\n<li class=\"li\">Known technical issues and workarounds that impact customers</li>\n<li class=\"li\">Time-consuming issues</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div class=\"p\">Analyzing tickets can be a manual process, and may be overwhelming at first. Having a\n                good strategy helps. Here's one process you can use to analyze your tickets and\n                identify required content: <ul class=\"ul\" id=\"topic_ixv_zbn_lcc__ul_snd_xjn_lcc\">\n<li class=\"li\">\n<strong class=\"ph b\">Categorize your tickets</strong>: How you categorize your tickets depends on\n                        the information you're collecting in tickets. Ideally, you'll want to\n                        categorize by issue, using a custom \"about\" field. Then, you can build an\n                        Explore report to see what your major ticket categories and issues are. See\n                            <a class=\"xref\" href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408828230554-Best-practices-for-finding-customer-issues-to-start-your-knowledge-base#topic_gk5_2hk_lj\" target=\"_blank\">Categorizing your tickets</a>.</li>\n<li class=\"li\">\n<strong class=\"ph b\">Drill-down into ticket groupings to find common issues</strong>: After you\n                        organize your tickets into categories, you'll want to create a view to dig\n                        into the categories with the most tickets and find the common, high\n                        frequency issues.

You can write short notes or\n                        bullet points, then use the tool to turn them into complete paragraphs. This\n                        can help you quickly ramp up your help center content. See <a class=\"xref\" href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/6267360002714\" target=\"_blank\">Using generative AI to expand and enhance\n                            help center content</a>.</li>\n<li class=\"li\">\n<strong class=\"ph b\">Determine what to document</strong>: Keep a tracking document where you can\n                        record issues you find, then determine what you want to document and set\n                        priorities for creating the content. Start by identifying 5% of your most\n                        common issues, and focus acting on those first. Taking small steps toward\n                        developing knowledge base content to address ticket issues will yield huge\n                        benefits.

For example, you\n                can analyze the following:<ul class=\"ul\" id=\"topic_xlh_bcn_lcc__ul_gnt_krn_lcc\">\n<li class=\"li\">\n<strong class=\"ph b\">Macros</strong>: If you use macros for common responses to tickets, you can\n                        look at your most used macros to find clues about your common customer pain\n                        points. You can then document the topics covered in those macros in your\n                        knowledge base. Macros that cover known issues and workarounds are a great\n                        resource for creating help articles. </li>\n<li class=\"li\">\n<strong class=\"ph b\">Tags</strong>: You can use the tags on tickets to help pinpoint common issues.\n                        Examine your tag cloud to see the 100 tags that have been most applied to\n                        tickets in the last 30 days. This will help you understand issues that may\n                        require knowledge base articles.</li>\n</ul>\nTo review  macros and tags for common issues, see <a class=\"xref\" href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408828230554-Best-practices-for-finding-customer-issues-to-start-your-knowledge-base#topic_d13_lyd_jj\" target=\"_blank\">Looking at other sources to determine customer\n                    issues</a>.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div aria-labelledby=\"ariaid-title4\" class=\"topic nested1\" id=\"id_y4h_j34_lcc\">\n<h2 class=\"title topictitle2\" id=\"ariaid-title4\">Strategy 3: Review existing content</h2>\n<div class=\"body\">\n<p class=\"p\">Existing content can be another source for determining issues and starting your\n                knowledge base. In most cases, it's ready-made content that can go directly in the\n                knowledge base with little or no editing. </p>\n<p class=\"p\">For example, some agents might have informal documentation, or \"cheat sheets,\" that\n                help them remember common issues and workarounds. Other agents may share information\n                with their team via a wiki, internal help center, or other informal process that you\n                could leverage. </p>\n<p class=\"p\">To review strategies for leveraging your existing content, see <a class=\"xref\" href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408828230554-Best-practices-for-finding-customer-issues-to-start-your-knowledge-base#topic_d13_lyd_jj\" target=\"_blank\">Looking at other sources to determine customer\n                    issues</a>. </p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div aria-labelledby=\"ariaid-title5\" class=\"topic nested1\" id=\"topic_gjf_ccn_lcc\">\n<h2 class=\"title topictitle2\" id=\"ariaid-title5\">Strategy 4: Listen to your community</h2>\n<div class=\"body\">\n<div class=\"p\">To learn about common issues and pain points in your community, you can: <ul class=\"ul\" id=\"topic_gjf_ccn_lcc__ul_ung_3g4_lcc\">\n<li class=\"li\">\n<strong class=\"ph b\">Talk to your agents</strong>: Agents can not only tell you what the common\n                        issues are, but often they can articulate exactly what documentation is\n                        required.

This new API marks the beginning of a phased transition towards replacing the current HC API with a more refined and sophisticated API landscape.</p>\n<p>With the Public API for Media, developers can programmatically manage media resources through a centralized Guide Media Library, a repository designed to handle all media files at the account level.</p>\n<p>Core functionalities include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Create Media: Upload new images and article attachments to the media library with relevant metadata.</li>\n<li>Read Media: Retrieve and view media files and their details.</li>\n<li>Update Media:\n<ul>\n<li>Renaming Media: Update the names of images and article attachments.</li>\n<li>Replacing Media: Replace existing media in all their placements.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Delete Media: Remove outdated or unnecessary media to keep the repository clean.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"h_01GD3S9GD63FPDGQSEFY88M3ND\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Why is Zendesk making this change?</span></h2>\n<p>The Public API for media management is essential for maintaining consistency and branding across various projects. It simplifies media management by offering a centralized repository for monitoring and overseeing all media files. This update will boost efficiency in updating and maintaining media content and foster improved collaboration by providing shared access to media resources. Ultimately, this transition to the new API will empower developers with superior external integration capabilities, paving the way for a more refined and sophisticated API landscape, gradually phasing out the current HC API.</p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01GD3S9TSPXM7M4WHYKYF4E84M\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What do I need to do?</span></h2>\n<p>Customers using the current HC API for media management will need to transition to the new Public API for Media to take advantage of its enhanced functionalities and capabilities. Developers should review <a href=\"https://developer.zendesk.com/api-reference/help_center/help-center-api/guide_medias/\">Guide Medias</a> in the developer documentation to understand how to interact with the new API and make necessary adjustments to their integrations.</p>\n<p>If you have feedback or questions related to this announcement, visit our <a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/community/topics\">community forum</a> where we collect and manage customer product feedback.
