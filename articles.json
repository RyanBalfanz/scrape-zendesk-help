One reason is that the system may take time to update and reflect the available space.</p>\n<p>Not all tickets have attachments, so deleting those with few or none don't significantly free up space allocated to your files. To manage storage, look for tickets with large attachments, as deleting them will free up more space.</p>\n<p>For more information, read the article: <a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408885871130-How-can-I-remove-attachments-from-tickets\">How can I remove attachments from tickets?</a></p>",

Previously, admins were required to configure settings in a pop-up window of the sidebar app.</p>\n<p>Weâve also added improvements to the app configuration, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The ability to change the caching interval</li>\n<li>Configuration for on-demand caching</li>\n<li>Reorder objects and fields on the landing page without editing the object first</li>\n<li>Improved filtering options for related objects during configuration</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"h_01J9M6WYN4QZSYSFSWVMVX4HF0\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An upgraded version of the sidebar app</span></h3>\n<p>We are also offering an <em>upgraded</em> <em>version</em> of the sidebar app. The upgraded app has a refreshed design with improved user experience, data visibility, and performance. Salesforce objects are displayed in a tab format.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://zen-marketing-documentation.s3.amazonaws.com/docs/en/salesforce_sidebar_app_new.png\" width=\"400\"></p>\n<p>Additionally, the upgraded app includes the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Record last fetched timestamp</li>\n<li>Informative error messages to enhance troubleshooting</li>\n<li>Improved navigation from primary objects to related objects</li>\n<li>Increased display records for related objects from 5 to 10 for better visibility</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Existing customers can <a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408834679066#topic_bkk_ql3_xcc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">switch to the upgraded app</a>, making it immediately visible to agents.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, existing customers can continue to use the legacy app until February 15, 2025. Admins can toggle between the new and old app versions using the switch setting. On February 15, all accounts using the legacy app will automatically be switched to the new version without being able switch back.</p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01GD3S9GD63FPDGQSEFY88M3ND\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Why is Zendesk making this change?</span></h2>\n<p>Zendesk is dedicated to providing a simplified and reliable user experience. This upgrade reflects our commitment to enhancing app design, flow, and data visibility while streamlining the configuration process. We have carefully considered customer feedback regarding key pain points and are thrilled to roll out this improved app version to all customers.</p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01J9M79JBNCTQ75YMA3CCNKHHS\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How will this affect me?</span></h2>\n<p>For customers who have already installed and configured the Salesforce app for Zendesk Support, all existing configurations have been automatically migrated to Admin Center.</p>\n<p>If youâd like to use the upgraded app now, <a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408834679066#topic_bkk_ql3_xcc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">follow these steps</a> to switch.

However, we highly recommend transitioning to the new Salesforce app for Zendesk Support by <a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408834679066#topic_bkk_ql3_xcc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">following these steps</a>, as the legacy app will be deprecated on February 15, 2025.</p>\n<p>If you have feedback or questions related to this announcement, visit our <a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/community/topics/1260801308170\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">community forum</a> where we collect and manage customer product feedback.

This functionality is crucial for maintaining a seamless user experience and optimizing your site's SEO.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This announcement includes the following topics:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#h_01GD3S97RDYVTAFTQ8WR9878VF\" target=\"_self\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What is changing?</span></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#h_01GD3S9GD63FPDGQSEFY88M3ND\" target=\"_self\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Why is Zendesk making this change?</span></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#h_01GD3S9TSPXM7M4WHYKYF4E84M\" target=\"_self\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What do I need to do?</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"h_01GD3S97RDYVTAFTQ8WR9878VF\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What is changing?</span></h2>\n<p>The Redirect Rules API allows you to create and manage redirects for various objects, such as articles, sections, categories, and community posts, that have been deleted or archived. This ensures that users do not encounter 404 errors when accessing outdated links. The API supports three primary use cases:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Redirecting Deleted Objects</strong>: If a help center article or section is removed, you can redirect the old URL to a new article or section. This avoids 404 errors and maintains SEO relevance.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Redirecting Previous URLs During Migration</strong>: If you're transferring content from a non-Zendesk platform but keeping the same subdomain, you can redirect the former URLs to the new Zendesk URLs. This preserves SEO for both users and search engine crawlers.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Redirecting Vanity URLs or Other Patterns</strong>: Establish vanity URLs or different patterns within your Zendesk subdomain or a host-mapped subdomain. This process involves creating shorter URLs that lead users directly to articles or custom pages.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"h_01J9M2JKGYDKBN0SZQSYVFS4KW\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Why is Zendesk making this change?</span></h2>\n<p>This API is designed to enhance user experience by avoiding broken links and ensuring continuous access to content, even after objects are deleted. It also bolsters SEO initiatives by preserving link equity and improving the navigational framework for users.</p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01GD3S9TSPXM7M4WHYKYF4E84M\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What do I need to do?</span></h2>\n<p>If you are a developer utilizing the Zendesk platform, you can start implementing the Redirect Rules API to manage your redirects effectively. Here are some steps to get started:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://developer.zendesk.com/api-reference/help_center/help-center-api/redirect_rules/\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\" style=\"color: #1155cc;\">Explore the API Documentation</span></a>: Familiarize yourself with the Redirect Rules API by reviewing the official API documentation to understand the available endpoints and data structures.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Set Up Redirect Rules</strong>: Begin creating redirect rules for any deleted objects or URLs that need to be redirected. Use the provided JSON format to structure your redirect rules.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Test and Validate</strong>: Ensure that your redirects are functioning correctly by testing the old URLs to confirm they lead to the new destinations.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you have feedback or questions related to this announcement, visit our <a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/community/topics\">community forum</a> where we collect and manage customer product feedback.
