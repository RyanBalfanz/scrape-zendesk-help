This issue impacted their ability to make calls and required manual corrections. Any customer who received SMS messages in the last five days would have been affected. On Monday, we identified the root cause and rectified the issue. Unfortunately, the previously deployed fix was accidentally rolled back yesterday. However, our engineers have re-deployed the fix, and the issue is now fully resolved. The fix ensures that any new user identities created during the active period of the fix do not have the rogue “1\" appended. Additionally, the temporary rollback has been corrected, ensuring that no new user identities are created with the erroneous “1”.</p></div>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>POST-MORTEM</strong></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">TBD</p> <h4><strong>FOR MORE INFORMATION</strong></h4>\n<p class=\"p1\">For current system status information about your Zendesk, check out our <a href=\"https://status.zendesk.com\">system status page</a>.

However, redaction suggestions proactively identify PII rather than rely on the agent to identify PII that needs to be redacted.</p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01J6JDHRYV4V4EBCSZ91VZC9W5\">Why is Zendesk making this change?</h2>\n<p>We're making this change so that you can achieve a more consistent redaction of PII in your account. This feature decreases the amount of time agents have to spend reading through tickets and identifying PII for redaction.</p>\n<p>This change also paves the way for future features that will allow you to add automation to PII redaction.</p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01J6JDHY83B8EMJ9SFV7CCQ1BJ\">What do I need to do?</h2>\n<p>If you have our Advanced Data Privacy and Protection add-on, you can configure redaction suggestions in Admin Center.

Participants heard from a panel of experts who shared practical tips and the latest innovations to improve support operations. The event was designed for both newcomers and experienced professionals, offering insights on optimizing workforce management and enhancing workflows. In this article, you'll find our event recording, Q&amp;A highlights, and the event presentation, making it a useful resource for anyone looking to improve their customer service strategies.</p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01J6G1D3ZKJVXACGH20Y6M8Z5F\"><strong>Event Recording<br><iframe src=\"//www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/yVqF8JR2RnE\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe><br></strong></h2>\n<h2 id=\"h_01J2J2PYMG0K4GVHW24T575C64\"><strong>Q&amp;A Summary </strong></h2>\n<div class=\"accordion\">\n<div class=\"accordion-item labeled-content\" data-content-labels=\"advanced\">\n<h4 id=\"h_01J2J3FBJ0WMM0ENT9KSCWQ9SQ\" class=\"accordion-header\"><button class=\"accordion-button\" type=\"button\" data-bs-toggle=\"collapse\" data-bs-target=\"#collapse-one\"><strong>How well does Zendesk WFM &amp; QA scale with growing businesses or fluctuating customer service demands?<br></strong></button></h4>\n<div id=\"collapse-one\" class=\"accordion-collapse collapse\">\n<div class=\"accordion-body\">\n<p><em>Zendesk QA:</em> In simple terms, Zendesk WFM and QA adjust exceptionally well with varying business sizes and customer service demands. Particularly with the QA component, the onboarding process is significantly expedited, which proves highly beneficial if your business experiences seasonal influxes. Moreover, it assists scaling businesses by ensuring seamless agent onboarding as your team grows. So both the WFM and QA elements of Zendesk are designed to adapt and grow with your business needs.<br><br><em>Zendesk WFM:</em> Zendesk WFM is a tool that aids in planning, forecasting, and scheduling tasks by offering reliable data. A key feature is its automatic tracking of work hours, ensuring no work time is missed. This tool is beneficial for all team sizes, as it provides accurate data essential for team management. Zendesk WFM also leverages AI to anticipate future needs and discount irrelevant past events, facilitating effective staffing and schedule management. In a nutshell, Zendesk WFM helps make team management and planning simpler.</p>\n<p> </p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<h4 id=\"01J6HYQ11WR5HPP5C3G1S05Q3P\" class=\"accordion-header\"><button class=\"accordion-button\" type=\"button\" data-bs-toggle=\"collapse\" data-bs-target=\"#collapse-two\"><strong>What key performance indicators (KPIs) does the QA module track, and how are they measured?</strong></button></h4>\n<div id=\"collapse-two\" class=\"accordion-collapse collapse\">\n<div class=\"accordion-body\">\n<p>We consider customer satisfaction (CSAT) and our own performance metrics (KPIs) very important. CSAT helps to gauge customer happiness but it's not always reflective of an agent's performance.</p>\n<p>So, we ensure that CSAT is aligned with quality scores, which helps distinguish between negative feedback caused by an agent's performance or due to other reasons such as product or process issues.</p>\n<p>We measure agent quality scores in two ways: one is the 'Internal Quality Score' (IQS), giving a percentage score for each reviewed ticket and providing an aggregate score for each agent, team, or the whole department.</p>\n<p>The second is the 'Auto QA Score' (AQS), which is assessed entirely by AI, providing a quick overview of all the tickets. This helps identify where human review is required.</p>\n<p>In summary, we majorly focus on the IQS, AQS and CSAT to ensure quality and satisfaction in our services.</p>\n<p> </p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<h4 id=\"01J6HZ8RHEH8TKYWZM9K26EQVF\" class=\"accordion-header\"><button class=\"accordion-button\" type=\"button\" data-bs-toggle=\"collapse\" data-bs-target=\"#collapse-three\"><strong>How do I start implementing workforce management?<br></strong></button></h4>\n<div id=\"collapse-three\" class=\"accordion-collapse collapse\">\n<div class=\"accordion-body\">\n<p>We recommend getting in touch with your account manager if you haven't done so already. We offer a 30-day trial so you can test it out and see the value it brings to your organization. Your account manager will be happy to assist you throughout this process. It's as simple as reaching out and giving it a try.</p>\n<p><strong>Resources: <span class=\"wysiwyg-color-black\"><a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/sections/6249085120410-\">Getting started with Zendesk workforce management</a></span></strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<h4 id=\"h_01J6HZXYVGRQ73M6PASA0Z3NDC\" class=\"accordion-header\"><button class=\"accordion-button\" type=\"button\" data-bs-toggle=\"collapse\" data-bs-target=\"#collapse-four\"><strong><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-black\">How does this process automate QA for complete coverage?</span></strong></button></h4>\n<div id=\"collapse-four\" class=\"accordion-collapse collapse\">\n<div class=\"accordion-body\">\n<p>We use two ways to fully automate your Quality Assurance (QA) process.</p>\n<p>The first is Auto QA, where AI assesses your tickets based on standard categories like greeting, closure, spelling and grammar, empathy, and tone of the agent. This takes care of the 'soft skills' aspects, saving you the time of meticulously checking each ticket.</p>\n<p>The second method involves manual focus on factors you particularly care about such as process adherence. We also use AI-powered spotlights, just like with VoiceQA, to identify tickets that might have sentiment extremes, churn risk, or display extraordinary agent performance.</p>\n<p>Not only does Auto QA review your tickets automatically, it also helps you prioritize the tickets that need your manual review. This way, your time on ticket review becomes more efficient and impactful.<br><br></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<h4 id=\"01J6J14BFQY9GXM0J1V2ZYG18C\" class=\"accordion-header\"><button class=\"accordion-button\" type=\"button\" data-bs-toggle=\"collapse\" data-bs-target=\"#collapse-five\"><strong><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-black\">What are the best ways to get the teams on board and engaged?</span></strong></button></h4>\n<div id=\"collapse-five\" class=\"accordion-collapse collapse\">\n<div class=\"accordion-body\">\n<p>Getting teams involved requires a step-by-step approach:</p>\n<p>1. Start with 'Performance Monitoring and Management'. Ask team members to log their tasks such as meetings or lunches. This minimal change helps collect useful activity data and familiarizes them with our productivity metrics.</p>\n<p>2. Next, introduce 'Resource Planning' using Zendesk WFM. Here, team members will be able to view their schedules, request time-off, or even swap shifts directly from Zendesk Support. They'll also receive notifications about any schedule changes. For managers, this is the stage to create data-driven shift layouts and roll out weekly or monthly schedules.</p>\n<p>By gradually adding elements ad helping teams familiarize themselves, we ensure smooth and engaging onboarding.</p>\n<p> </p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<h4 id=\"01J6J20KRZS9REDQ5N6SZ8K2FH\" class=\"accordion-header\"><button class=\"accordion-button\" type=\"button\" data-bs-toggle=\"collapse\" data-bs-target=\"#collapse-six\"><strong><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-black\">Will the QA feature have customizable rubrics?</span></strong></button></h4>\n<div id=\"collapse-six\" class=\"accordion-collapse collapse\">\n<div class=\"accordion-body\">\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-black\">Yes.

Also, thanks to our point-oriented metrics, you're able to have a more in-depth productivity reporting in place by measuring more than just - how many tickets ended up being solved at the end? You're having an insight into their productivity during an entire ticket life cycle which reflects through having Handled, Escalated, Attended, or Bounce Points attributed.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-black\"><strong>Resources: <a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/6676772528026\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Tracking agent time spent outside of Zendesk (EAP) , </a><a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/6443376866074\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">About workforce management dashboards</a></strong></span></p>\n<p> </p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<h4 id=\"01J6J3E52547QNNJPXCYJK1FYH\" class=\"accordion-header\"><button class=\"accordion-button\" type=\"button\" data-bs-toggle=\"collapse\" data-bs-target=\"#collapse-ten\"><strong><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-black\">What kind of concrete examples do you have from other customers?</span></strong></button></h4>\n<div id=\"collapse-ten\" class=\"accordion-collapse collapse\">\n<div class=\"accordion-body\">\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-black\">Sendle: \"Easier to check attendance, but also real-time adherence, at a glance.

It works equally well for internal teams that use Zendesk to create tickets. With Zendesk WFM, you can track how much time is being spent on different aspects of your internal tasks, and understand productivity in real-time or historically. Essentially, whether it's customer-facing or internal tickets, Zendesk WFM treats them all the same, helping you manage your workflows efficiently.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<h4 id=\"01J6J6WT3QMBN5D4VXC5EHGNSH\" class=\"accordion-header\"><button class=\"accordion-button\" type=\"button\" data-bs-toggle=\"collapse\" data-bs-target=\"#collapse-twelve\"><strong><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-black\">How effective is Zendesk WFM in providing real time insights into agent performance and workload?</span></strong></button></h4>\n<div id=\"collapse-twelve\" class=\"accordion-collapse collapse\">\n<div class=\"accordion-body\">\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-black\">Zendesk WFM helps you see real-time updates about your agents' work.

And if needed, you can directly access any ticket just by clicking on it from the report. So, Zendesk WFM keeps you connected with your team's workload in a practical and straightforward way.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-black\"><strong>Resources: <a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/6443331637018\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">A</a><a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/6443331637018\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">bout the Agent status</a><a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/6443331637018\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> page,</a> <a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/6443347506970\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">About the Agent activity page</a></strong></span></p>\n<p> </p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<h4 id=\"01J6J7F0PJJYSQEAZS3NJW38F0\" class=\"accordion-header\"><button class=\"accordion-button\" type=\"button\" data-bs-toggle=\"collapse\" data-bs-target=\"#collapse-thirteen\"><strong><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-black\">Can Zendesk WFM be customized to accommodate different team structures or business models?</span></strong></button></h4>\n<div id=\"collapse-thirteen\" class=\"accordion-collapse collapse\">\n<div class=\"accordion-body\">\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-black\">Organizational structure is completely independently approached and customized to support customers in building out different sites (Locations), teams, permissions and roles, work streams (lines of businesses/skills/buckets of work)</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-black\"><strong>Resources: <a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/6443374452250\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">About WFM general tasks</a>, <a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/7037879703322\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Setting up locations and shifts in Zendesk WFM</a>, <a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/7069811858586\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Setting up teams in Zendesk WFM</a>, <a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/6866245012378\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Creating and editing workforce management dashboards</a>, <a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/6443374452250\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Managing user access in your WFM account</a>, <a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/7037879703322\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Managing WFM roles and permissions</a></strong></span></p>\n<p> </p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<h4 id=\"01J6J7MSJ0K38D7D1R8X9HSEPM\" class=\"accordion-header\"><button class=\"accordion-button\" type=\"button\" data-bs-toggle=\"collapse\" data-bs-target=\"#collapse-fourteen\"><strong><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-black\">How can I get assistance with setup to get the most out of these tools?</span></strong></button></h4>\n<div id=\"collapse-fourteen\" class=\"accordion-collapse collapse\">\n<div class=\"accordion-body\">\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-black\">For assistance with setup, we have several resources ready for you.

If they're working on different types of tickets, you can set up work streams for each category. This way, the agent activity screen will show changes as soon as an agent switches from one ticket type to another giving you real-time and historical data.</p>\n<p>If you prefer to see when agents are handling tickets in general, no customization is needed. Importantly, this set up is fully automated for agents. They don't need to manually switch statuses when they change groups. It's all based on their actual clicks, making the process easy and efficient.</p>\n<p> </p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<h4 id=\"01J6J8HWBHSKWPCJGA0XQ24029\" class=\"accordion-header\"><button class=\"accordion-button\" type=\"button\" data-bs-toggle=\"collapse\" data-bs-target=\"#collapse-eighteen\"><strong><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-black\">I have a global workforce and I need to schedule my agents across multiple different timezones.

See <a href=\"https://developer.zendesk.com/api-reference/help_center/help-center-api/article_attachments/\">Article Attachments</a>.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>The Guide Media Objects API </strong>is now available. Guide media objects are files that can be added to help center articles either as embedded in the text or as attachments. The API provides CRUD (create, read, update, delete) capabilities, as well as features like file renaming and replacement, categorization, and permission controls. See the <a href=\"https://developer.zendesk.com/api-reference/help_center/help-center-api/guide_medias/\">Guide media objects</a> API reference.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Zendesk Support OAuth grant types.</strong> On February 17, 2025, Zendesk will stop accepting the use of implicit grants and password grants as valid grant types for obtaining OAuth access tokens. This applies to all <code>/api/v2</code> APIs except the Live Chat API. If you're using OAuth 2.0 to authenticate API requests, you must switch to the authorization code grant flow.

Customers will either need to migrate to the <a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408845965210\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Authorization Code Flow</a> grant type or API tokens. Starting today, anyone wanting to use OAuth 2.0 for authenticating API calls can only use the Authorization Code Flow grant type.</p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01GD3S9GD63FPDGQSEFY88M3ND\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Why is Zendesk making this change?</span></h2>\n<p>In line with OAuth 2.0 best practices, the Implicit grant and the Resource Owner Password Credentials (Password) grant are now considered insecure and disallowed by the <a href=\"https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-oauth-security-topics\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">OAuth 2.0 Security Best Current Practice</a>.</p>\n<p>The Implicit grant used to be recommended because it directly returned the access token without needing an extra authorization code step. This was required for Public OAuth clients that could not securely store the <em>client_secret</em>. This method is now discouraged due to security risks, as it sends access tokens via HTTP redirects without client confirmation. It has been replaced with the more secure Authorization Code Grant with Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE). The Password grant is an outdated method for obtaining an access token by using a user's credentials. This method is now discouraged because it requires the client application to handle the user's password and send it to the authorization server, which results in an increased attack surface. It is also not compatible with two-factor authentication.</p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01GD3S9TSPXM7M4WHYKYF4E84M\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What do I need to do?</span></h2>\n<p>If you’re currently using Implicit grant or Password grant, we have emailed you separately about what your next steps are.</p>\n<p>If you’re currently using Implicit grant, you will need to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Update your current call to the <code class=\"ph codeph\">/oauth/authorizations/new</code> endpoint to use <code class=\"ph codeph\">response_type: code</code> instead of <code class=\"ph codeph\">response_type: token</code> and include the <code class=\"ph codeph\">redirect_uri</code> and <code class=\"ph codeph\">state</code> params if not already present.
