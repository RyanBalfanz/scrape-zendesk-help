This proactive approach enhances the user experience and ensures users understand the best practices for utilizing the bot’s capabilities.</p>\n<p>It is important to understand that the Zendesk bot is not designed to process random words or single letters. This limitation can affect the bot's functionality, leading to incorrect answers, irrelevant articles, or unexpected behavior. When users input vague or incomplete queries, the bot may struggle to generate meaningful responses, which can frustrate users and undermine their trust in the system.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, during the bot's testing phase, it is essential to conduct tests that accurately reflect the actual search behavior of end users. Instead of trying to anticipate and control every possible text input that could be entered into the widget composer, testers should concentrate on realistic scenarios that users are likely to encounter. This approach will help ensure the bot performs effectively in real-world situations, resulting in a more positive user experience.</p>\n<p>For more information, see these articles:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408824263578-Creating-a-conversation-bot-for-your-web-and-mobile-channels\">Creating a conversation bot for your web and mobile channels</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408835784602-Testing-the-end-user-s-messaging-experience\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Testing the end user's messaging experience</a></li>\n</ul>",

This was required for public OAuth clients that could not securely store the <em>client_secret</em>. This method is now discouraged due to security risks, as it sends access tokens via HTTP redirects without client confirmation. It has been replaced with the more secure authorization code grant with Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE). The password grant is an outdated method for obtaining an access token by using a user's credentials. This method is now discouraged because it requires the client application to handle the user's password and send it to the authorization server, which results in an increased attack surface. It is also not compatible with two-factor authentication.</p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01GD3S9TSPXM7M4WHYKYF4E84M\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What do I need to do?</span></h2>\n<p>If you’re currently using the implicit grant flow, you'll need to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Update your current call to the <code class=\"ph codeph\">/oauth/authorizations/new</code> endpoint to use <code class=\"ph codeph\">response_type: code</code> instead of <code class=\"ph codeph\">response_type: token</code> and include the <code class=\"ph codeph\">redirect_uri</code> and <code class=\"ph codeph\">state</code> params if not already present.

This configuration prioritizes the assignment of oldest and highest priority tickets. However, customers who use SLAs often place the highest priority on the ticket that is closest to breaching SLA targets.</p>\n<p>This release now gives admins the ability to decide whether tickets should be ordered in the queue and assigned based on time to SLA breach or the standard ticket priority and eligibility timestamp. When users opt to base ticket order on SLAs, the ticket that is closest to breaching an SLA target is placed at the front of the queue. All tickets subject to SLAs are prioritized over tickets without an SLA target. This means even low priority tickets are inserted into the queue ahead of all tickets without an SLA. The tickets without an SLA target are then ordered based on priority and then timestamp.</p>\n<p>For example, if three tickets arrive at the same time and go into the same omnichannel routing queue, two with different SLA targets and one with urgent priority but no SLA target, they'd be queued for assignment in the following order:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The ticket with a first reply time target of 1 minute.</li>\n<li>The ticket with a first reply time target of 5 minutes.</li>\n<li>The urgent priority ticket without an SLA target.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>For more information, see <a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/6712096584090#topic_bh4_g45_fdc\">Ordering tickets by time to SLA</a> breach and <a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4828787357210\">Managing your omnichannel routing configuration</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01GD3S9GD63FPDGQSEFY88M3ND\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Why is Zendesk making this change?</span></h2>\n<p>Giving admins a way to route and prioritize tickets by their time to SLA breach can help customers achieve their SLA targets. Even tickets that start off at the bottom of the queue because they are far from a breach will gradually rise through the queue as they approach a breach. This prevents tickets from getting stuck at the back of the queue for prolonged periods of time as they might if you receive a constant stream of urgent and high priority tickets while relying on ticket priority and eligibility timestamp to prioritize the assignment of work.</p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01GD3S9TSPXM7M4WHYKYF4E84M\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What do I need to do?</span></h2>\n<p>This feature is being rolled out to all customers on Growth plans and above.

This is ideal for Microsoft customers looking to connect their online Microsoft 365 or Exchange servers and leverage their Exchange/Outlook workflows.</p>\n<p>The main advantage of this solution is that it allows you to send and receive email traffic to and from your customers using your domain’s email services, while ensuring encrypted and secure relays to and from Zendesk.</p>\n<p>Microsoft Exchange is the server powering all Microsoft email products, including Microsoft 365. Therefore, the Zendesk Microsoft Exchange Connector is compatible with the online version of all Microsoft email products. The connector is incompatible with Exchange Server on-premise. In this situation, the <a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/6740880198810\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Authenticated SMTP Connector</a> may be a better option.</p>\n<p>This article includes the following topics:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#h_01JBG86QBZA7FRGHNFW6SJ557A\">About the Exchange Connector</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#h_01JBG8MNGB9JDT47FVVTPBMM5D\">Considerations</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#h_01JBG8PZMQHXA4RVTDTKCVBA0E\">Important information about email headers</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#h_01JBG8XMYBBEAF5DJ6KK7Y1KHG\">Connecting your Microsoft Exchange account</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"h_01JBG86QBZA7FRGHNFW6SJ557A\">About the Exchange Connector</h2>\n<p>Using an Exchange API, the Microsoft Exchange Connector allows you to fetch email from an Exchange inbox and automatically convert email messages to tickets. The API is also leveraged to deliver outbound email from Zendesk to your Exchange mailbox.</p>\n<p>Figure 1: Email flow with the Microsoft Exchange Connector</p>\n<p><img class=\"image\" src=\"https://zen-marketing-documentation.s3.amazonaws.com/docs/en/email_exchange_connector_flow.png\" width=\"800\"></p>\n<p>Zendesk Support frequently checks for new email in your Exchange inbox. Only new, unread email messages in the inbox will be converted into tickets. Ticket notifications will be sent from your Microsoft email address.</p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01JBG8MNGB9JDT47FVVTPBMM5D\">Considerations</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>CCs and followers must be turned on in your account.</li>\n<li>We recommend testing this feature in your <a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/6150628316058\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Zendesk sandbox environment</a> before using it in production.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"h_01JBG8PZMQHXA4RVTDTKCVBA0E\">Important information about email headers</h2>\n<p>Email headers, (such as To, From, CC, and Reply-To) contain important data and metadata about an email message.</p>\n<p>Your administrator may want to change email headers for several reasons. However, it’s important to note that some header fields should never be altered since they are critical for ensuring the correct delivery and integrity of the message. Changing standard headers at the account's email domain before outbound sending is not supported. Any issues that emerge as a result of this should be investigated and corrected at the external domain.</p>\n<p>The below headers should persist throughout the outbound relay process:</p>\n<pre>Auto-Submitted: auto-generated<br>X-Auto-Response-Suppress: All<br>X-Mailer: Zendesk Mailer<br>X-Zendesk-From-Account-Id: ******<br>X-Zendesk-Email-Id: ************************</pre>\n<p>Changing your email header fields doesn’t change how Zendesk works; it only changes how you send your outbound messages and how you might receive responses. The relationships between the requester, agents, and CCs in the email and subsequent ticket should not change.</p>\n<p>The Exchange Connector doesn't give you the ability to send email on behalf of your Zendesk system support addresses (example: support@<em>yoursubdomain</em>.zendesk.com).</p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01JBG8XMYBBEAF5DJ6KK7Y1KHG\">Connecting your Microsoft Exchange account</h2>\n<p>You must be a Zendesk administrator to connect your Exchange account to Zendesk.</p>\n<p>When you connect to your Exchange account, make sure you sign in to the Exchange account you want to connect to. If you sign in to a different Exchange account in the same browser as your instance of Zendesk Support, you will connect to the wrong account.</p>\n<p><strong>To connect to your Microsoft Exchange account</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>In Admin Center, click <strong>Channels</strong> in the sidebar, then select <strong>Talk and email</strong> &gt; <strong>Email</strong>.</li>\n<li>In the Support addresses section, click <strong>Add address</strong>, then click <strong>Connect external address</strong>.</li>\n<li>Select <strong>Microsoft Exchange Connector</strong>.</li>\n<li>Click <strong>Continue to Microsoft</strong>.<br><img class=\"image\" src=\"https://zen-marketing-documentation.s3.amazonaws.com/docs/en/email_exchange_connector_microsoft.png\" width=\"400\"><br>You will be redirected to Microsoft.</li>\n<li>Click <strong>Accept</strong> to approve access to that email account.<br>You may need to sign in to Microsoft using your account credentials for that email address.</li>\n<li>Click <strong>Accept</strong>, then click <strong>Done</strong>.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><img class=\"image\" src=\"https://zen-marketing-documentation.s3.amazonaws.com/docs/en/email_exchange_connector_done.png\" width=\"400\"></p>\n<p>Your Zendesk instance is now connected to your Microsoft account.

This requires more setup and configuration with your domain or email service, but it is ideal for on-premise servers or domains that leverage additional layers of security on inbound/outbound traffic, like Mimecast.</li>\n<li>Use <strong>outbound-only authenticated relay</strong> to use standard auto-forwarding of inbound email traffic to Zendesk, but allow for an authenticated outbound connection with your email domain or service, so all outbound sending for the connected addresses occurs through your domain or email service. This setup allows for cloud-based email services that don’t offer authenticated outbound relays to other systems, like Exchange Online, Office365 Cloud, and Google Workspace.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"h_01JBFKVVWJP7GY9PNWQT5QDJ0P\">Why is Zendesk making this change?</h2>\n<p>Our customers requested more secure methods to have their email traffic arrive at Zendesk, and for Zendesk to send outbound traffic through.</p>\n<p>The Authenticated SMTP Connector:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ensures outbound TLS encryption (inbound also with the two-way version).</li>\n<li>Allows for authoritative sending (SPF/DKIM) and delivery tracking from your domain.</li>\n<li>More easily satisfies information handling, redaction, and compliance requirements or policies before outbound sending.</li>\n<li>Provides actionable visibility into unauthenticated inbound email ticket creation and update events (two-way version only).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>While the Authenticated SMTP Connector is platform-agnostic and relies on well-established protocols that already exist within most email services, we created two versions to better suit the needs of our customers' email needs and configurations.</p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01JBFMRYSWWB9PD0P7KCYF10JX\">What do I need to do?</h2>\n<p>No action is required. If you don't need authenticated email relays, you can continue using Zendesk as you have up until now.</p>\n<p>If you're interested in using the Authenticated SMTP Connector, you can learn more <a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/6740880198810\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>If you have feedback or questions related to this announcement, visit our <a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/community/topics/4408860477850\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">community forum</a> where we collect and manage customer product feedback.
