For more information on closed Zendesk instances, see <a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408887573274-Understanding-options-for-end-user-access-and-sign-in\">Options for end user access</a>.</p><h2 id=\"h_01GD3S9GD63FPDGQSEFY88M3ND\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Why is Zendesk making this change?</span></h2><p>Your account security is our top priority. The option to access APIs with a username and password is inherently insecure as passwords can be compromised, reused and this method no longer aligns with modern best practices for API authentication. Removing the ability to use the same username and password for API access mitigates the risk of unauthorized access and changes to your account in case your credentials are compromised.</p><h2 id=\"h_01GD3S9TSPXM7M4WHYKYF4E84M\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What do I need to do?</span></h2><p>If you are currently authenticating API requests with your email and password, switch to using API tokens. To do this:</p><ol>\n<li data-list-item-id=\"ef096dfe02e5aff69b9b832d4cb847b65\">Generate an API token in Admin Center.
