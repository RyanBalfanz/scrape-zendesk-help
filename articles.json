To be eligible to be assigned work through omnichannel routing, an agent must have both an eligible status for the channel as well as spare capacity for the channel.</p>\n<p>Originally, omnichannel routing was designed to assign work to the available agent with the highest spare capacity for the channel.</p>\n<p>Now, you can choose between this standard capacity-based assignment method and round robin assignment. When you turn on round robin assignment, omnichannel routing looks at the time elapsed since the agent was last assigned work from that channel rather than how much spare capacity the agents have. Agents still must have an eligible status and some amount of spare capacity to be assigned work when round robin in configured.</p>\n<p>See <a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/7990049158554\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Using round robin routing for email, messaging conversations, and call tickets</a> and <a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4828787357210\">Managing your omnichannel routing configuration</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01GD3S9GD63FPDGQSEFY88M3ND\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Why is Zendesk making this change?</span></h2>\n<p>Many Zendesk customers believe that the round robin methodology is a fairer way to distribute tickets to their agents than the current capacity-based method. Although the capacity-based method is designed to load balance across agents, but could be perceived as penalizing agents who work through their tickets most efficiently and therefore receive significantly more work than less efficient agents. The addition of this new option enables admins to decide which method works best for their agents.</p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01GD3S9TSPXM7M4WHYKYF4E84M\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What do I need to do?</span></h2>\n<p>No action is required.

Consequently, agents were unable to send messages or initiate calls to these end users.</p>\n<h3 id=\"h_01J7B3JGJKBPS06DWMQ0ET2F1N\"><span style=\"color: #06363c;\">Timeline</span></h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>September 04, 2024 01:05 PM UTC | September 04, 2024 06:05 AM PT </strong><br>Between 12:16 PM UTC on August 30th and 09:15 AM UTC on September 2nd, customers using Talk and Support reported an extra “1” being added to end-user phone numbers. This issue impacted their ability to make calls and required manual corrections. Any customer who received SMS messages in the last five days would have been affected. On Monday, we identified the root cause and rectified the issue. Unfortunately, the previously deployed fix was accidentally rolled back yesterday. However, our engineers have re-deployed the fix, and the issue is now fully resolved. The fix ensures that any new user identities created during the active period of the fix do not have the rogue “1\" appended. Additionally, the temporary rollback has been corrected, ensuring that no new user identities are created with the erroneous “1”.</p>\n</div>\n<h3 id=\"h_01J7BQAGZGGT5MA2KWTRBKCBWC\" class=\"undefined\"><strong><br>POST-MORTEM</strong></h3>\n<h3 id=\"h_01J7B3MY286YEPWQJJEXKVEDRV\"><span style=\"color: #06363c;\">Root Cause Analysis</span></h3>\n<p>This incident occurred due to an unintended consequence of a cleanup pull request (PR) that reactivated an old rollout process from 2018. This process automatically updated new SMS end users' phone numbers, adding an \"sms_capability\" attribute with a value of \"1\". The extension model fetched this information, resulting in an erroneous “1” being appended to the phone numbers of new SMS end users. </p>\n<h3 id=\"h_01J7B3MY28YGPCA7K4YDNYH1S8\"><span style=\"color: #06363c;\">Resolution</span></h3>\n<p>To resolve this issue, the problematic code responsible for adding the \"1\" to new SMS end users' phone numbers was identified and disabled. Ensuring that the sms_capability attribute is no longer incorrectly applied to phone numbers.</p>\n<h3 id=\"h_01J7B3MY2850V22JPB988ZF0S3\"><span style=\"color: #06363c;\">Remediation Items</span></h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Fix the User Phone Extension model to pick the appropriate records to add phone number extension to end user numbers. [Done]</li>\n<li>Eliminate unused phone identity update code from the SMS system, as it was discovered to be outdated and malfunctioning. [To do]</li>\n<li>Clean up any existing user_phone_attributes that were incorrectly created with the sms_capability attribute. [To do]</li>\n<li>Implement an automated test to ensure that sending a message to a Zendesk Text number results in a correctly formatted ticket and new end user creation. This test should simulate calling the end user to ensure their phone number is valid and not appended with an erroneous digit. [To do]</li>\n<li>Develop a more sophisticated alerting system that can differentiate between truly invalid numbers and false positives to minimize unnecessary alerts while still catching legitimate issues.

As a workaround, export each tab separately. Then, use an external tool to merge your documents. For example, if you exported several PDF files, use an external tool to merge those files.</p>\n<p>For more information, see this article: <a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4483481898266-Exporting-dashboard-tabs-and-reports\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Exporting dashboard tabs and reports</a>.</p>",

Chat agents that are already logged in will be able to continue to chat, but the transcription will be delayed and chats will not show in the history.

This surge resulted in the Webhooks system hitting its throughput limit, leading to significant delays. Additionally, in Pod 27, the autoscaling mechanism failed to adequately handle the increased traffic, further exacerbating the delays.</p>\n<h3 id=\"h_01J7DYVGXKJ0AF1VKS3WEGFW7X\"><span style=\"color: #06363c;\">Resolution</span></h3>\n<p>To fix this issue, the Webhooks dispatcher and the Untrusted Egress Zone (UEZ) were scalably ramped up to handle the traffic surge. Furthermore, the specific customer was requested to slow down their operations. Once the necessary scaling adjustments were made, the backlog started to decrease, and normal service was gradually restored across all affected pods.</p>\n<h3 id=\"h_01J7DYVGXKMS8NBDQ84F6DWD8C\"><span style=\"color: #06363c;\">Remediation Items</span></h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Define horizontal auto-scaling policies for Webhooks services. [IN PROGRESS]</li>\n<li>Investigate enhancing rate-limiting logic to account for a single customer with many subdomains. [SCHEDULED]</li>\n<li>Investigate and fix the secure egress tier auto-scaling issue in Pod 27. [SCHEDULED]</li>\n<li>Streamline the deployment and configuration change process to reduce friction during emergency resolutions. [IN PROGRESS]</li>\n<li>Implement subdomain-specific kill switches for Webhooks. [IN PROGRESS]</li>\n<li>Add monitoring alerts to flag when the Webhooks backlog or delivery latency becomes too large. [SCHEDULED]</li>\n<li>Publicly document Webhooks rate limits to inform customers and preemptively manage traffic.
