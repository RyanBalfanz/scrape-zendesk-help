Why is the displayed caller ID different from the actual caller ID of the end user?</p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01HYBAYSYEBM197897FQ8P2KW9\">Answer</h2>\n<p>The caller ID may display a different number for several technical reasons. Common explanations include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your provider settings: Some providers replace the original caller number with the forwarding number or another default number.</li>\n<li>Possible provider limitations with the caller ID passthrough: When forwarding calls, not all telephony providers support passing through the original caller ID. This is often due to network limitations or policies aimed at preventing spoofing.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To find a solution, reach out to the provider of your forwarding phone number. They can check their policies, settings, and capabilities regarding forwarded calls.</p>\n<p>For more information on Talk, see this article: <a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408827987482-Preparing-to-use-Talk\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Preparing to use Talk</a>.</p>",

Together these updates pack more than 100 accessibility improvements to Zendesk Help center’s out-of-the-box end user experience while also improving the developer experience and security.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This announcement includes the following topics:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#h_01GD3S97RDYVTAFTQ8WR9878VF\" target=\"_self\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What is changing?</span></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#h_01GD3S9GD63FPDGQSEFY88M3ND\" target=\"_self\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Why is Zendesk making this change?</span></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#h_01GD3S9TSPXM7M4WHYKYF4E84M\" target=\"_self\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What do I need to do?</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"h_01GD3S97RDYVTAFTQ8WR9878VF\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What is changing?</span></h2>\n<h4 id=\"h_01HYGE9EY5N3GR782MCWPZWQRY\"><span style=\"color: #434343;\">Accessibility</span></h4>\n<p>Since releasing the templating API v3, we have made more than 100 accessibility improvements to the templating API and Copenhagen theme that together form the out-of-the-box Help center end user experience.</p>\n<p>One of the changes that has enabled this is that we are now using the <a href=\"https://garden.zendesk.com/\">Zendesk Garden Design System component library</a> in more places of the Copenhagen theme. Most notably we have completely reimplemented the request form in help center using Garden.</p>\n<p>Garden is a React-based UI component library optimized for usability and accessibility, and constantly updated and maintained by our dedicated Garden team who are experts in UX and accessibility. This gives you all the usability and accessibility benefits of Zendesk Garden for your end users.</p>\n<h4 id=\"h_01HYGE9EY56FA6P0FKYKN212BS\"><span style=\"color: #434343;\">Developer experience</span></h4>\n<p>A notable change is that the request form HTML has been changed from being server-side rendered to being client-side rendered using Zendesk Garden components as part of the theme. This means that you can now customize the request form’s UI much directly from the theme code and even use a different UI component library than Garden if you want.</p>\n<p>Another notable improvement for developers is the JSON serialization helper that makes it easier to use server-side rendered data from the templating api in the frontend with JavaScript.</p>\n<h4 id=\"h_01HYGE9EY52M91402RG2XNN4ZK\"><span style=\"color: #434343;\">Security</span></h4>\n<p>The update to the Copenhagen theme with the new request form also means that by default the credit card field in the request form will only accept the last four digits of the credit card. We have done this to ensure PCI compliance of the request form when using the credit card field.</p>\n<p>This measure prevents end users from having their credit card information stolen if they for example are using a malicious browser plugin that listens to keystrokes.</p>\n<h4 id=\"h_01J1D4VHN2ZZ8DD16QDFKHM5SS\">Where can I find more information?</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://developer.zendesk.com/api-reference/help_center/help-center-templates/v3/\">Upgrading from Templating API v3</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408842751002--Adding-a-PCI-compliant-credit-card-field\">PCI compliance documentation</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h4 id=\"h_01J1D4WN8DBQ86NX1DYABG68WW\">Expected rollout schedule</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>July 2, 2024: Custom themes able to use API v4</li>\n<li>July 3, 2024: Update of standard Copenhagen themes starting</li>\n<li>July 10, 2024: Update all of standard Copenhagen themes completed</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"h_01GD3S9GD63FPDGQSEFY88M3ND\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Why is Zendesk making this change?</span></h2>\n<p>We are making this change to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Improve the accessibility of the help center end user experience.

See <a href=\"https://developer.zendesk.com/api-reference/help_center/help-center-templates/v3/\">Upgrading from Templating API v3</a>.</p>\n<p>Before upgrading, check your theme for deprecated helpers or helper markup that may have changed between versions.</p>\n<p>You can find the changes between the templating APIs in:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://developer.zendesk.com/documentation/help_center/help-center-templates/v1/\">Upgrading from Templating API v1</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://developer.zendesk.com/documentation/help_center/help-center-templates/v2/\">Upgrading from Templating API v2</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Several <a href=\"https://developer.zendesk.com/documentation/help_center/help-center-templates/advanced_helpers/\">advanced template helpers</a> have slightly different output in v4. You can see the difference between v2 and v4 output by switching between version tabs. See <a href=\"https://developer.zendesk.com/api-reference/help_center/help-center-templates/introduction/\">Templating API</a> in the developer documentation for more information.</p>\n<p>To ensure that none of your custom functionality breaks when upgrading, we recommend that you test any theme customizations that use the updated helpers or target modals before upgrading to v4. </p>\n<h4 id=\"h_01HYGEHYNN860SMVK8W355ESDN\"><span style=\"color: #434343;\">I’m using a Marketplace theme on a standard license</span></h4>\n<p>If you’re using a theme from the <a href=\"https://www.zendesk.com/marketplace/themes/\">Zendesk Theme marketplace</a> on a standard license, ask the developer of the theme if they’re planning an update for v4.

There are several causes of ticket suspension which can impact the ability for an email to create a ticket, such as the use of email for bulk ticket creation instead of the API and channels framework. For more information, see the article: <a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408828416282-Causes-for-ticket-suspension\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Causes of ticket suspension</a></p>\n<ul>\n<li>When a ticket is suspended it also can cause a discrepancy in the creation date timestamp.

Why are some recipients missing?</p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01HYBAYSYEBM197897FQ8P2KW9\">Answer</h2>\n<p>Dashboard delivery is divided into virtual groups when being sent out. These virtual groups are created based on matching locale and timezone settings. If both values do not match, a new virtual group is formed. As a result, if no other recipients share the same settings, you will see the email addressed only to you.</p>\n<p>For example, if a scheduled dashboard is configured to send to the following recipients:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Recipient 1\n<ul>\n<li><span>Email: address1@test.com</span></li>\n<li><span>Language: English US</span></li>\n<li><span>Time zone: GMT+02 Madrid</span></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<span>Recipient 2</span>\n<ul>\n<li><span>Email: address2@test.com</span></li>\n<li><span>Language: Spanish</span></li>\n<li><span>Time zone: GMT+02 Madrid</span></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<span>Recipient 3</span>\n<ul>\n<li><span>Email: address3@test.com</span></li>\n<li><span>Language: Spanish</span></li>\n<li><span>Time zone: GMT+1 London</span></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<span>Recipient 4</span>\n<ul>\n<li><span>Email: address4@test.com</span></li>\n<li><span>Language: English US</span></li>\n<li><span>Time zone: GMT+0 UTC</span></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In the scenario above, the recipients do not have matching locale and timezone settings, so each recipient will see themselves as the only address this scheduled dashboard is being delivered to. Conversely, if multiple recipients have matching locale and time zone settings, the list of recipients will be visible in the<code>TO:</code> field of the email:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/7513071453978\"></p>\n<p>For more information, see this article: <a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408843602714-Scheduling-dashboard-deliveries\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Scheduling dashboard deliveries</a>.</p>",

At that point, omnichannel routing stops considering the ticket's skills, and instead looks only at the availability of agents in the appropriate groups.</p>\n<p>Until now, agents had to do something, such as change their status or update a ticket, for omnichannel routing to reconsider their eligibility to receive a ticket after the skills timeout occurs. Now, that is no longer the case. When a skills timeout occurs, any available agent in the appropriate groups can be assigned the ticket automatically, without any action required of them.</p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01GD3S9GD63FPDGQSEFY88M3ND\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Why is Zendesk making this change?</span></h2>\n<p>Based on feedback, we realized this is a better approach to balancing the need to respond to end users promptly while still ensuring tickets are assigned to agents with the skills required to solve the ticket whenever possible.
