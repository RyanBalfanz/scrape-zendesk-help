It is <strong>mandatory</strong> that you provide your recipients with a clear and accessible way to opt out of receiving future messages from your business.</p><p>‍</p><p><strong>Acceptable Opt-Out Methods:</strong></p><p>‍</p><ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Reply with \"STOP\":</strong> The simplest and most common method is to instruct your recipients to reply with the word \"STOP\" to any of your WhatsApp messages.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Dedicated Opt-Out Keyword:</strong> You can also implement a dedicated opt-out keyword (e.g., \"UNSUBSCRIBE\" or \"QUIT\"). Clearly communicate this keyword to your recipients.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Opt-Out Link:</strong> Include a link in your messages that directs users to a webpage or mechanism where they can easily unsubscribe.</li>\n</ul><p>‍</p><p><strong>Important:</strong></p><p>‍</p><ul>\n<li>You must honor opt-out requests promptly and ensure that users who have opted out do not receive further messages from your business.</li>\n<li>It is recommended that you include a brief message in your initial communication informing recipients of how to opt out.</li>\n</ul><h2><strong>Repercussions of Non-Compliance</strong></h2><p>Failure to comply with WhatsApp for Business guidelines, especially those related to opt-out mechanisms, can result in severe consequences, including:</p><p>‍</p><ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Warnings: </strong>Warnings will be issued if the guidelines are not followed to allow you to rectify the situation.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Blocked Numbers: </strong>If the warnings are not adhered to in time, the numbers in question will be blocked from sending further messages.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Account Suspension:</strong> WhatsApp may suspend or even ban your business account if you are found to be violating their policies.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Damage to Reputation:</strong> Non-compliance can harm your business's reputation and erode customer trust.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Legal Action:</strong> In certain jurisdictions, you may face legal action for sending unsolicited messages.</li>\n</ul><h2><strong>Best Practices for Outbound Messaging</strong></h2><ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Obtain Consent:</strong> Whenever possible, obtain explicit consent from users before sending them WhatsApp messages.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Relevant and Valuable Content:</strong> Ensure that your messages are relevant and provide value to your recipients.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Respect Frequency:</strong> Avoid sending messages too frequently, as this can lead to user frustration and opt-outs.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Clear Communication:</strong> Clearly identify your business and the purpose of your message.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>WhatsApp Business Messaging Policy Update (November 2024):</strong> Businesses must obtain opt-in permission before messaging people on WhatsApp, which can be general and not specific to WhatsApp, as long as businesses comply with local laws. <a href=\"https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/overview/getting-opt-in\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Here</a> is a link for more information.</li>\n</ul><h2><strong>We're Here to Help</strong></h2><p>If you have any questions or concerns about compliance or best practices, please don't hesitate to reach out to our support team.</p><p>‍</p><p><strong>By following these guidelines, you can ensure a positive and compliant messaging experience for your clients while leveraging the power of WhatsApp for your business.</strong></p><p>References for additional information:</p><ul>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/overview/getting-opt-in\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/overview/getting-opt-in</a> </li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://business.whatsapp.com/policy\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://business.whatsapp.com/policy</a> </li>\n</ul>",

It can be positioned in different locations across the Engage platform and activated in multiple ways depending on an Agent’s actions.</div><h2>Why are Utilities important?</h2><p>Agents often need to use multiple applications to resolve a customer query. Switching between the applications is an inefficient process, leading to longer call times and lower customer satisfaction. </p><p>Utilities in Engage make it easier for Agents to get the information they need to assist a customer quicker and within the Engage application. This results in a better experience for both the Agent and the customer.</p><p>Utilities also ensure that when an Agent needs to perform additional tasks/actions (such as create a follow up task during a call), they can do it quickly and easily whilst remaining on the contact screen.</p><h2>Utility Types</h2><h3>iFrame Embed</h3><ul>\n<li>Display 3rd party applications within Engage, based on the configuration of the Utility and the relevant Workflow</li>\n<li>Enables an agent to read, write, or update data within the 3rd party application (based on their permission within the 3rd party application)</li>\n<li>Reduces the need for Agents to switch between multiple applications</li>\n<li>Ensures focus on the ongoing contact</li>\n</ul><h4>Example</h4><p>The example below shows an Agent using two Utilities:</p><ul>\n<li>Side Panel: An iFrame Embed Utility displaying a 3rd party booking application, enabling the Agent to book an appointment for the customer without navigating away from the contact</li>\n<li>Main Panel: An iFrame Embed Utility using a custom Google Map to display points of interest to the Agent, enabling the Agent to provide information (in this case a list of stations) to the customer without navigating away from the contact</li>\n</ul><div><img src=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/9731464089882\" alt=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\"></div><h3>Tasks</h3><ul>\n<li>Display Tasks within Engage, based on the configuration of the Utility and the relevant Workflow</li>\n<li>Enables the Agent to efficiently create follow-up Tasks whilst on a contact</li>\n<li>If you have previously utilised Tasks within Engage, you will notice that the functionality within Tasks has not changed with the introduction of Utilities</li>\n<li>Tasks within Utilities ensures Admins have greater control as to when and where Tasks appear to Agents</li>\n</ul><h4>Example</h4><p>The example below shows an Agent using a Task Utility:</p><ul>\n<li>The Task Utility is configured by the Admin and displays a form for the Agent to complete</li>\n<li>This example enables the Agent to quickly schedule a callback at the time specific by the customer</li>\n</ul><div><img src=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/9731464104346\" alt=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\"></div><p>To an Agent, all Utilities behave and appear in a similar fashion. They can all be configured to appear in either the Main or Side Panel within Engage, and can be made visible during a contact, in after call work, or both.<br>Once an Agent opens a Utility, the functionality within the Utility will be dependant on what the Admins have configured</p><h2>Other things to consider.</h2><p>Utilities are contact driven - they are only available to Agents whilst on a contact or in after call work (ACW). Utilities are designed to only display information to Agents if it is relevant to their ongoing contact or ACW. </p><p>As an example, a dashboard displaying metrics to an Agent is is not a recommended use case for a Utility.</p><p>‍</p>",

The new stack can safely be deployed without any impact on the existing stack. When ready, the Engage Account configuration can be changed to point to the new CloudFormation stack and the solution can be tested. Once everything is confirmed to be working, the old CloudFormation stack can safely be deleted. If any challenges are encountered during testing, the Engage Account configuration can again be changed to point to the old CloudFormation stack. This ensures that an operational environment can be maintained while any potential issues are investigated on the new CloudFormation stack.</p><p>‍</p>\n\n<div class=\"note note\">\n<strong>NB:</strong> Local Measure does not recommend that environments using email routing be upgraded without assistance from Local Measure.

The reason for this is that the stack name is included in the names of the resources, which could result in the eventual resource path exceeding the character limit for that service.</p><p>The template should be filled in with exactly the same values as for the original stack, with the following <strong>important exceptions</strong>:</p><div>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Parameter</th>\n<th>Mandatory</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Authentication with Cognito</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>EnableCognito</td>\n<td>y</td>\n<td>Select Existing</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>UserPoolId</td>\n<td>y</td>\n<td>Navigate to the userpool which was created by the original CloudFormation stack.

      "body": "<p>For enhanced customer engagement and satisfaction, there are instances where agents require assistance during active calls or chats. This assistance can be automated using Connect Contact Lens, which can process voice streams and chat transcripts in real-time and respond to predefined scenarios set by contact centre managers.\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>For instance, if a customer expresses dissatisfaction about a delivery delay (the running example that we will use in this document), the system can swiftly detect this issue and provide agents with optimal instructions to placate the customer, reassuring them that the matter is being addressed. This capability can be extended to various specific requirements for notifying agents about Connect Contact Lens detections or suggestions.</p><p>In Engage, we support not only standard Connect Contact attributes but also Label/Panel/Button attributes. This document outlines the solution for applying these attributes along with Connect Contact Lens to automatically assist and notify agents.</p>\n\n<h2>Contact Attributes</h2><p>Standard attributes are excellent for providing agents with context about the contact they are managing. Engage provides Label and Panel attributes, which are essentially the standard contact attributes but presented with a distinctive and noticeable appearance.\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><p>These attributes can be tailored to use a variety of colour themes and icons.

The overall solution architecture is illustrated below:</p><p>The steps include:</p><ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Create Connect Contact Lens Rule </strong>with an action type of publishing an EventBridge event. This rule is designed for real-time call/chat conditions, ensuring that contact attributes are promptly updated (near real-time) immediately after the rule is triggered by Connect Contact Lens.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Create a Lambda function</strong> to handle the actions, specifically updating the contact's Standard/Label/Panel attributes. This ensures that agents will see these updates in real-time in the middle of Engage.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Create an EventBridge rule </strong>with a target of the Lambda function.</li>\n</ol><p>By following these steps and deploying this architecture, updates to contact attributes will be handled swiftly and seamlessly, providing real-time insights for agents during engagement.</p><div><img src=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/9731439554714\" alt=\"__wf_reserved_inherit\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\"></div><p>‍</p><p>‍</p><p>‍</p><p>‍</p><h3>Create Connect Contact Lens Rule</h3><ol>\n<li>Navigate to the Rules section under Contact Lens, under the Analytics and Optimization Menu.</li>\n<li>Click on \"Create a rule\".</li>\n<li>Choose \"Conversational analytics\".</li>\n<li>In the \"When\" dropdown, choose \"A contact lens real-time call (or chat) analysis is available\".

Once the issue is resolved in the CCP or Workspace, but you are still experiencing it in Engage after a hard refresh, then we advise reaching out to the Local Measure Support team at <a href=\"mailto:engage-support@getlocalmeasure.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">engage-support@getlocalmeasure.com</a> for further assistance.</p><p>‍</p><h1>Flow Specific Diagnosis</h1><p>If changes have been made to Contact Flows, this could be the root cause for various issues.</p><p>Review the related Contact Flows’ change history to confirm if recent changes have been made, and by who.</p><p>Review the CloudWatch logs in Amazon Console for additional information.</p><p>‍</p><h1>UI Issues</h1><ul>\n<li>A hard refresh should resolve most UI related issues.</li>\n<li>If the button to Accept calls is not working, check that the agent doesn’t have Desk Phone enabled in their Agent settings, as this causes the call to be forwarded to another phone number and they can’t accept the call from the desktop.</li>\n<li>Desktop shows the agent is logged in, but they do not receive calls. <br><ul>\n<li>Refresh the page and re-authenticate to log back into Amazon Connect.</li>\n<li>If the user did not log out at the end of their shift, and just closed the browser, the desktop won’t know their session has expired until they interact with the page or refresh it.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul><p>‍</p>",

Additionally, you'll find guidelines on managing and responding to incoming chats in Engage, concluding interactions, and logging customer profiles. It's designed to provide agents with a clear understanding of the chat process from start to finish.</p>\n\n<h2>Initiating a chat</h2><p>A chat interaction can be initiated using any of the following channels:</p><ul>\n<li>Chat widget on the company website</li>\n<li>Facebook Messenger</li>\n<li>WeChat</li>\n<li>WhatsApp</li>\n<li>SMS</li>\n<li>Email</li>\n<li>Twitter</li>\n</ul><p>When a customer starts a chat, one of two things will happen: </p><ol>\n<li>The customer is connected to the next available agent.</li>\n<li>A ‘Bot’ that has been configured to help the customer will respond. If the Bot is unable to help with the query it will transfer the customer to an agent. At any point during the conversation with the Bot the customer may type ‘Speak to an agent’, or simply ‘Agent’, and the chat will be transferred to an agent.</li>\n</ol><h3>Initiate a Chat from the website </h3><p>Use your browser to navigate to your website where the Chat widget has been enabled. Click on the chat icon to initiate a Chat.</p><div><img src=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/9731500374426\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\"></div><p>Once the chat widget has been opened the customer is presented with a Welcome message.

Agents can re-run the automatic detection at any time by clicking the refresh icon on the translation banner.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Manual Agent override</strong> - If the detected language seems incorrect, Agents have the option to manually select a language. They can do this by clicking on the language displayed in the translation banner and typing in the required language</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Manual attribute override</strong> - The language used can be set using a custom contact attribute. As an example, you can set the _LM_language attribute in a contact flow, using the locale code of the required language as the value. e.g. <code>{\"_LM_language\":\"fr-CA\"} </code>\n</li>\n</ol><div><img src=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/9731450917786\" alt=\"__wf_reserved_inherit\"></div><h3>Auditing Smart Translations</h3><p>For auditing purposes, a complete record of both the the original (non-translated) and translated messages are stored in an S3 bucket within your AWS environment. To access these, you can review the contents within your CTRs as well as ChatTranslations S3 bucket within your Connect directory.</p><p>‍</p><h3>FAQs</h3><p>Q: Which languages are supported?</p><p>A: The languages supported depend on the model used to power Smart Translations. Neither Anthropic nor Open AI publish a list of supported languages for translations, however they are known to be proficient across a wide range of languages. Local Measure has performed testing in dozens of languages with great success. Specifically, Local Measure has tested English (US, AU, CA, GB), Dutch, French, Mandarin, Spanish, Portuguese, German (DE, AT, SU), Italian, Xhosa, Afrikaans and many more languages.</p><p>‍</p><p>Q: Will an End Customer know that the conversation is being translated?</p><p>A: Not by default. Local Measure recommends adding an automated message that is sent to the End Customer if they are on a queue that may use Smart Translations.</p><p>‍</p><p>Q: How will I be charged for Smart Translations?</p><p>A: There are 2 elements; the AI Service you choose to use, and Local Measure unit consumption. Note that unit consumption applies as soon as the language detection step within Smart Translations is performed. This means that 2 units will be added to the relevant contact even if language detection determines that there is no need for translation.</p><p>‍</p><p>Q: How does Smart Translations detect the End Customer's language?</p><p>A: Smart Translations uses the content from the first 5 messages an End Customer sends to determine their language.</p><p>‍</p><p>Q: Can I see Smart Translations in historical Contacts / Contact Search?</p><p>A: Yes, when viewing historical Contacts you will be able to see both the original and translated messages.</p>",
