One reason is that the system may take time to update and reflect the available space.</p>\n<p>Not all tickets have attachments, so deleting those with few or none don't significantly free up space allocated to your files. To manage storage, look for tickets with large attachments, as deleting them will free up more space.</p>\n<p>For more information, read the article: <a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408885871130-How-can-I-remove-attachments-from-tickets\">How can I remove attachments from tickets?</a></p>",

This functionality is crucial for maintaining a seamless user experience and optimizing your site's SEO.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This announcement includes the following topics:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#h_01GD3S97RDYVTAFTQ8WR9878VF\" target=\"_self\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What is changing?</span></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#h_01GD3S9GD63FPDGQSEFY88M3ND\" target=\"_self\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Why is Zendesk making this change?</span></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#h_01GD3S9TSPXM7M4WHYKYF4E84M\" target=\"_self\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What do I need to do?</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"h_01GD3S97RDYVTAFTQ8WR9878VF\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What is changing?</span></h2>\n<p>The Redirect Rules API allows you to create and manage redirects for various objects, such as articles, sections, categories, and community posts, that have been deleted or archived. This ensures that users do not encounter 404 errors when accessing outdated links. The API supports three primary use cases:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Redirecting Deleted Objects</strong>: If a help center article or section is removed, you can redirect the old URL to a new article or section. This avoids 404 errors and maintains SEO relevance.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Redirecting Previous URLs During Migration</strong>: If you're transferring content from a non-Zendesk platform but keeping the same subdomain, you can redirect the former URLs to the new Zendesk URLs. This preserves SEO for both users and search engine crawlers.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Redirecting Vanity URLs or Other Patterns</strong>: Establish vanity URLs or different patterns within your Zendesk subdomain or a host-mapped subdomain. This process involves creating shorter URLs that lead users directly to articles or custom pages.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"h_01J9M2JKGYDKBN0SZQSYVFS4KW\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Why is Zendesk making this change?</span></h2>\n<p>This API is designed to enhance user experience by avoiding broken links and ensuring continuous access to content, even after objects are deleted. It also bolsters SEO initiatives by preserving link equity and improving the navigational framework for users.</p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01GD3S9TSPXM7M4WHYKYF4E84M\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What do I need to do?</span></h2>\n<p>If you are a developer utilizing the Zendesk platform, you can start implementing the Redirect Rules API to manage your redirects effectively. Here are some steps to get started:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://developer.zendesk.com/api-reference/help_center/help-center-api/redirect_rules/\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\" style=\"color: #1155cc;\">Explore the API Documentation</span></a>: Familiarize yourself with the Redirect Rules API by reviewing the official API documentation to understand the available endpoints and data structures.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Set Up Redirect Rules</strong>: Begin creating redirect rules for any deleted objects or URLs that need to be redirected. Use the provided JSON format to structure your redirect rules.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Test and Validate</strong>: Ensure that your redirects are functioning correctly by testing the old URLs to confirm they lead to the new destinations.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you have feedback or questions related to this announcement, visit our <a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/community/topics\">community forum</a> where we collect and manage customer product feedback.

This way, when someone uses an SSO service like Okta or a company account to sign in to your help center, they will be automatically identified in your Zendesk Messaging widget. If they start a chat with you, you can pull up their data, identify them with the correct user profile, and serve them the proper generative replies in the bot. </li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>LogRocket <strong>(Chat)</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://www.zendesk.com/marketplace/apps/chat/1070759/logrocket/\">LogRocket</a><span> </span>helps you resolve tickets faster with AI summaries of user sessions.  LogRocket's Zendesk integration leverages Galileo AI to watch user sessions any time a user submits a Zendesk ticket and summarizes the key moments, providing the information you need to enter a conversation with full context.
