This new API marks the beginning of a phased transition towards replacing the current HC API with a more refined and sophisticated API landscape.</p>\n<p>With the Public API for Media, developers can programmatically manage media resources through a centralized Guide Media Library, a repository designed to handle all media files at the account level.</p>\n<p>Core functionalities include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Create Media: Upload new images and article attachments to the media library with relevant metadata.</li>\n<li>Read Media: Retrieve and view media files and their details.</li>\n<li>Update Media:\n<ul>\n<li>Renaming Media: Update the names of images and article attachments.</li>\n<li>Replacing Media: Replace existing media in all their placements.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Delete Media: Remove outdated or unnecessary media to keep the repository clean.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"h_01GD3S9GD63FPDGQSEFY88M3ND\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Why is Zendesk making this change?</span></h2>\n<p>The Public API for media management is essential for maintaining consistency and branding across various projects. It simplifies media management by offering a centralized repository for monitoring and overseeing all media files. This update will boost efficiency in updating and maintaining media content and foster improved collaboration by providing shared access to media resources. Ultimately, this transition to the new API will empower developers with superior external integration capabilities, paving the way for a more refined and sophisticated API landscape, gradually phasing out the current HC API.</p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01GD3S9TSPXM7M4WHYKYF4E84M\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What do I need to do?</span></h2>\n<p>Customers using the current HC API for media management will need to transition to the new Public API for Media to take advantage of its enhanced functionalities and capabilities. Developers should review <a href=\"https://developer.zendesk.com/api-reference/help_center/help-center-api/guide_medias/\">Guide Medias</a> in the developer documentation to understand how to interact with the new API and make necessary adjustments to their integrations.</p>\n<p>If you have feedback or questions related to this announcement, visit our <a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/community/topics\">community forum</a> where we collect and manage customer product feedback.

Due to an inadequate response to this failure, the Agent-graph component continued to wait up to 60 seconds for a response, causing timeout errors and resulting in 503 service errors. Contributing factors include that the system did not switch to an alternative data source in a timely manner, and the monitors in place did not trigger alerts because the issue was resolved before hitting the thresholds.</p>\n<h3 id=\"h_01J5NBHTBGV0WCS6FRWCSBTSMC\"><span style=\"color: #06363c;\">Resolution</span></h3>\n<p>To fix this issue, the system automatically recovered as the memory-caching system came back online. We identified that the reboot of this system caused the delays, and it was confirmed that the issue was self-resolving, requiring no immediate manual intervention to restore service.</p>\n<h3 id=\"h_01J5NBHTBGD074709AHJQZKPKW\"><span style=\"color: #06363c;\">Remediation Items</span></h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Reduced timeout for user cache retrieval.</li>\n<li>Consider performing chaos testing to simulate such failures in a controlled environment. </li>\n<li>Review and adjust alert thresholds to ensure quicker detection and response time.</li>\n<li>Reach out to AWS to investigate the unexpected reboot of the memory-caching system to prevent similar future occurrences.</li>\n</ol>\n<p class=\"p1\"> </p>\n<h4 id=\"h_01J5NBF60BWVCNNRF6NB11TD0R\"><strong>FOR MORE INFORMATION</strong></h4>\n<p class=\"p1\">For current system status information about your Zendesk, check out our <a href=\"https://status.zendesk.com\">system status page</a>.

For more information, see the article: <a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408821737498-Deleting-end-users#topic_xtk_lds_tdb\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Permanently deleting users</a>.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">If you downgrade an agent in your Zendesk instance to an end-user role, Zendesk will automatically deactivate this agent in WFM. This may take up to 12 hours for the system to register the downgrade.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Note that removing an agent won't remove all corresponding data. For example, a removed user with activity last month will still have the same registries on the platform, just no further activity after that.</p>",

These keys were disabled as part of a new key rotation automation process. This revocation caused the Zendesk App Market service to lose access to the public cloud storage resource bucket, resulting in errors when generating responses for the critical Apps API endpoint.</p>\n<h3 id=\"h_01J58WZQVQE3E424VNS1A7G549\"><span style=\"color: #06363c;\">Resolution</span></h3>\n<p>The issue was resolved by reinstating the keys. This action restored access to the public cloud storage resource bucket and allowed the Zendesk App Market service to function correctly again.</p>\n<h3 id=\"h_01J58WZQVQ5MEA3FDK8ABCZPR3\"><span style=\"color: #06363c;\">Remediation Items</span></h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Replace IAM user access to the public cloud storage resource buckets for the ZAM service.</li>\n<li>Disabled automated key revocation and work on implementing a manual process instead.</li>\n<li>Create additional alerts to monitor diagnostic endpoints.</li>\n</ol>\n<h4 id=\"h_01J58CXX7SSMV6D86B195GFYPK\"><strong>FOR MORE INFORMATION</strong></h4>\n<p class=\"p1\">For current system status information about your Zendesk, check out our <a href=\"https://status.zendesk.com\">system status page</a>.

More information to come.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>August 01, 2024 12:58 PM UTC | August 01, 2024 05:58 AM PT </strong><br>We have restarted the server specifically affecting the Chat service in Pod 23, and we are seeing improvements on the backend. However, you may notice a delay in chat data saving for ongoing chats during this period. Additionally, there is a temporary discrepancy between the status shown in the status switcher in the Agent workspace and the server. As a result, an agent might appear ONLINE in the Agent Workspace but be OFFLINE on the server, which could affect chat ticket routing.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>August 01, 2024 01:49 PM UTC | August 01, 2024 06:49 AM PT </strong><br>To reiterate, there should be no data loss, but the ongoing chats for the affected accounts during this issue may have been dropped prematurely. These chats will be recovered and saved, albeit with a time delay. We also consulted with our infrastructure partner, who confirmed that they had an underlying issue on their end. Thank you for your patience as we worked to fully resolve this issue.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"> </p>\n</div>\n<h3 id=\"h_01J586SXQNGERQE799J1T88SXW\" class=\"p1\"><strong>POST-MORTEM</strong></h3>\n<h3 id=\"h_01J586SQ15FW7BB7JFQ6W6C0FC\"><span style=\"color: #06363c;\">Root Cause Analysis</span></h3>\n<p>This incident was caused by an unexpected AWS infrastructure failure that affected a particular compute capacity instance.</p>\n<h3 id=\"h_01J586SQ15FFJ5V8FYWZW34W4T\"><span style=\"color: #06363c;\">Resolution</span></h3>\n<p>To resolve this issue, we restarted the affected compute capacity instance, which subsequently migrated the service to another stable AWS host, effectively resolving the problem.</p>\n<h3 id=\"h_01J586SQ15WN37S8HXX7WAQRNH\"><span style=\"color: #06363c;\">Remediation Items</span></h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Ensure automatic restart of the LiveChat server if it is shut down by AWS, using the service that allows us to run code without provisioning or managing servers.</li>\n<li>Update the alerting system for more accurate notifications.</li>\n<li>Shorten the timing for the Chat Backfill mechanism.</li>\n<li>Conduct resilience testing on the fixes in partnership with the responsible team.</li>\n</ol>\n<h4> </h4>\n<h4 id=\"h_01J478Z64QKF77X8T336BH2WHK\"><strong>FOR MORE INFORMATION</strong></h4>\n<p class=\"p1\">For current system status information about your Zendesk, check out our <a href=\"https://status.zendesk.com\">system status page</a>.
