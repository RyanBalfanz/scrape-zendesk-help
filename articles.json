Our expert panel delved into key topics such as customization, analytics, and security, showcasing pivotal tools like Custom Objects, Dashboard Builder, and Redaction Suggestions.</p>\n<p>The event provided valuable insights into elevating customer support, leveraging advanced analytics, and ensuring data security. Our experts delivered in-depth demos and addressed key queries during an interactive live Q&amp;A session.</p>\n<p>If you missed the live event, the full recording, a detailed Q&amp;A summary, and additional resources are available in this article.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01J2J1JBEGN4H4873183H69Z3S\"><strong>Event Recording</strong></h2>\n<p><strong><iframe src=\"//www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/w3DIRrnWurU\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01J2J2PYMG0K4GVHW24T575C64\"><strong>Q&amp;A Summary </strong></h2>\n<h4 id=\"h_01J2J3FBJ0WMM0ENT9KSCWQ9SQ\"><strong>Q1. What are some of the best ways to build out this functionality if you don't have a bot yet?</strong></h4>\n<p>The Dataset exporter is indeed the feature that is designed for this use case. At first, it will allow to <a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/6037992005914-Exporting-datasets-from-Explore-Beta\">export raw data as CSV files.</a> For anyone curious you can join the Beta now <a href=\"%C2%A0https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1wesv3ykZXv7GOsif_ZZUF6vEFLqdfB6y0uxeJyDhs5U\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">via this signup form</a>! </p>\n<p> </p>\n<h4 id=\"01J40273S2P8SKY59SSPF085NB\"><strong>Q2. Is there a way to undo a redaction in case something was redacted in error?</strong></h4>\n<p>No, at this time, there is no way to undo a redaction. However, your feedback is valuable, and we will consider it for future updates.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h4 id=\"01J402C40DSD73JRCMS5EAG00Y\"><strong>Q3. Where does HIPAA come into play with Zendesk’s Trusted and Flexible Platform?</strong></h4>\n<p>Zendesk Support and Suite plans at the Professional level and higher include a signed HIPAA BAA. <a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408828395802-Security-Configuration-Requirements-for-HIPAA-or-HDS-Enabled-Accounts-on-Zendesk\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Our documentation lays out the best way</a> to maintain HIPAA compliance using Zendesk. Not all products are covered.<br><br></p>\n<h4 id=\"01J402GTK37CS7N39KEB91J2M1\"><strong>Q4. Are there plans to have scoped API tokens that only give access to a specific set of features?</strong></h4>\n<p>We've had some preliminary discussions about this and there is a long term roadmap that plans to address these issues, but we have not yet settled on a solution.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h4 id=\"01J402JPME0P9Y968JTB1XV68M\"><strong>Q5. Are there plans to have an onboarding page for Marketplace apps that clearly show (and limit) what data they can access?</strong></h4>\n<p>While it's not currently on our roadmap, we will share your suggestion with our Marketplace Product Team for potential inclusion in future updates.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h4 id=\"01J402MNEAGBFNDYK2T5T6XSTD\"><strong>Q6. One instance, two brands, two SSO solutions: are there plans to limit SSO to a specific brand?</strong></h4>\n<p>This is planned. We will be investigating it in the coming year, though we can't yet confirm a timeline just yet.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h4 id=\"01J402PC861GZBJ32HWMMFDDZG\"><strong>Q7. Can we bulk delete tickets based off request type or tag? Would love this feature!</strong></h4>\n<p>Our advanced data privacy and protection package offers a feature called advanced data retention policies which gives you this exact capability!</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h4 id=\"01J402RM2W2MCADVA9DC49EXHJ\"><strong>Q8. Can you redact on a closed ticket?</strong></h4>\n<p>Not yet, but certainly on our roadmap. We're incrementally offering actions that you could perform on closed tickets. Redaction is one of the actions on our radar for the upcoming quarters.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h4 id=\"01J402TD8EQZCS90XEABBMKTH5\"><strong>Q10. Simplified access logs will be accessible for all or only Enterprise?</strong></h4>\n<p>Access logs will be available as part of the Advanced Data Privacy and Protection add-on, which itself is available to <a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/6119316155930-Buying-the-Advanced-Data-Privacy-and-Protection-add-on\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Enterprise plans only</a>. <br><br></p>\n<h4 id=\"01J402WDBRETWXREP6QDQTY3NY\"><strong>Q11. Are private groups only avail on certain plans?</strong></h4>\n<p>Yes, it's available only in <a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/7156636128794-About-private-ticket-groups\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Enterprise plans for both Suite and legacy Support</a>.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h4 id=\"01J402YQ2S41RSEWCJE44RYA6G\"><strong>Q12. Love the new views count on a dashboard. Is there any plan for a drill-in on this count? We'd love to see who is using the dashboards.</strong></h4>\n<p>It is a good idea but it is not on the roadmap for now. Thank you for sharing it. It is a technically complex feature to implement.<br><br></p>\n<h4 id=\"01J403CDKPH40ANZ3A4PK3TF5P\"><strong>Q13. Can we clone classic dashboards during this transition period?</strong></h4>\n<p>It won't be possible to clone classic dashboards during the transitionary period but it will still be possible to edit existing dashboards built with the classic builder.<br><br></p>\n<h4 id=\"01J403EAM9TBC38FNK364BC9H5\"><strong>Q14. Will there be a feature to include cascading filters. For example, we have a category Fields which are broken down into subcategories. If the user selects a ‘category’ in the filter the sub-category should only show those values that are a subset of the parent category?</strong></h4>\n<p>We are actually discussing the cascading functionality, but there is no decision yet made on what filter types it will cover and when we will work on it.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h4 id=\"01J403RZHSQKJS0BJZPMH850W8\"><strong>Q15. Are Custom Objects reportable?</strong></h4>\n<p>Custom objects are not yet reportable, but this is a frequently requested feature and on our roadmap.<br><br></p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01J404JF1G1FPBGVQQB4SE161D\"><strong>Event Resources</strong></h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1qaDHAeXsDepsmsFIbNubs5NMeGu8jO2VDZodzTwV27I/edit?usp=sharing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Event Presentation</a><br><a href=\"https://usergroups.zendesk.com/administrator-user-group/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Admin User Group </a><br><a href=\"https://youtu.be/w3DIRrnWurU\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Event Recording</a></p>",

Through initial use and user feedback, we identified several areas for improvement using ChatGPT-4o. This upgrade leverages advanced prompt engineering and the enhanced capabilities of ChatGPT-4o to address the following issues:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Improved response accuracy.</li>\n<li>Reduction of language errors in expansions and tone changes, as well as accuracy issues with ticket summarization.</li>\n<li>Mitigation of errors related to max ticket length when summary is used, due to ChatGPT-4o's larger context window.</li>\n<li>Enhanced feature performance, ensuring efficient agent operations.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"01J3YYKEJK6HW5ZGQBVXZHZ6Y1\">Why is Zendesk making this change?</h2>\n<p>These features are widely used across various industries, with over 1.5 million monthly uses. We anticipate that these enhancements, which are based on user feedback, will further boost efficiency, reducing the time to first response and resolution, thereby increasing customer satisfaction.</p>\n<p>We understand that new ChatGPT models generally offer better accuracy, improved performance, and fewer hallucinations. To stay ahead, we have invested and will continue to invest in improving our testing and regression processes, enabling us to more swiftly adopt future ChatGPT versions while maintaining high quality standards.</p>\n<h2 id=\"01J3YYKZG81WNYKCW13JJD5722\">What do I need to do?</h2>\n<p>If you have the <a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/5524125586330\">Advanced AI add-on</a> and you've already <a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/6948495103002\">turned on the generative AI setting</a> in the Admin Center, then no further action is necessary.
