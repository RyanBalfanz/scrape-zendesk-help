This innovative tool empowers you to create realistic training tickets that agents can complete directly within Zendesk Support.</p>\n<p>This announcement answers the following questions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#h_01JJWV2CNDGTQRDVGW7FGMGBPH\">What’s changing?</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#h_01JJWV2CNDSPCYPQ10ASM78VTB\">Why is Zendesk making this change?</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#h_01JJWV2CNDT3BZDF4NQ33VA36E\">What do I need to do?</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"h_01JJWV2CNDGTQRDVGW7FGMGBPH\">What’s changing?</h2>\n<p>Many Zendesk customers who want to train their agents on customer interactions rely on outdated Learning Management Systems with limited integration to Zendesk. These Learning Management Systems (LMS) often:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Focus solely on reading materials or videos, neglecting the adult learning principle of \"learning by doing.\"</li>\n<li>Use unrealistic or out-of-context training examples that fail to reflect genuine customer interactions.</li>\n<li>Ignore the valuable institutional knowledge embedded in real-life tickets handled by experienced agents.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To address these challenges, we've introduced the LMS Conversation Simulator. Admins can use this app to create training templates and assign training tickets to agents. Key features include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>AI-driven test tickets: Generate realistic tickets that simulate actual end-user interactions.</li>\n<li>Customizable training templates: Design reusable templates tailored to your training needs.</li>\n<li>Agent assignment: Assign training tickets to individual agents, including the ability to set the number of test tickets.</li>\n<li>Performance tracking: Monitor agent performance during training sessions using Support (required) and optional QA features.</li>\n<li>Training schedule formalization: Integrate with Workforce Management (optional) to organize your training schedule.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"h_01JJWV2CNDSPCYPQ10ASM78VTB\">Why is Zendesk making this change?</h2>\n<p>We hear you! Every organization using Zendesk to support customers - be they consumers, businesses, or employees - requires effective training for their agents. We have listened to your requests for Learning Management System capabilities within the Zendesk ecosystem and are thrilled to deliver this initial feature for your exploration.</p>\n<p>Zendesk Labs is committed to innovation and exploring new product areas and technologies. We value your feedback on which LMS features you would like to see prioritized.

This behavior happens when a specific task is assigned and when agents are either working or taking a break.</p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01JJM8B0D4NKE9QQBKP49ZW1N1\">Answer</h2>\n<p>This behavior is expected when the computer experiences a loss of connectivity, such as going offline, entering sleep mode, or being disconnected from the internet for a certain duration. The system automatically updates the task status to <strong>Offline</strong> due to network inactivity.</p>\n<p>To mitigate this situation and maintain the status of ongoing tasks, agents can utilize the task lock feature. This feature allows them to lock the task they are currently engaged in when they anticipate that their computer might lose its active internet connection or when there is a lack of activity.</p>\n<p>By locking the task, agents can ensure that their progress is preserved, and the task will not be automatically switched to <strong>Offline</strong> status, allowing for a smoother workflow and minimizing disruptions.</p>\n<p>For further details on how to implement the task lock feature, refer to these articles:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/6443329357210-Activating-task-lock\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Activating task lock</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/6443329257114-Using-task-lock\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Using task lock</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>",

Each restart generated additional metadata in our in-memory database, causing memory bloat until the system eventually ran out of memory, impacting other services that shared the same database instance.<br><br></p>\n<h4 id=\"h_01JJSR8GTXKZTH7451QJ1ZNNW3\"><span style=\"color: #666666;\">Resolution</span></h4>\n<p>To resolve the issue, the team removed unnecessary metadata and unacknowledged keys from the database to free up memory. Additionally, the instance types were increased to accommodate the load, and a successful deployment of the service was completed.<br><br></p>\n<h4 id=\"h_01JJSR8GTX8EPSFVNSPE0ZGJG5\"><span style=\"color: #666666;\">Remediation Items</span></h4>\n<ol>\n<li>Add Alerts: Implemented alerts for Out of Memory (OOM) conditions in the chat service.</li>\n<li>Adjust Memory Limits: Lowered the threshold for memory limits to allow for earlier intervention before reaching critical levels.</li>\n<li>Runbook Improvements: Enhanced documentation and runbooks for handling the chat service and database key management.</li>\n<li>Database Clustering: Planned to separate the database instances for different services to avoid shared memory issues in the future.</li>\n</ol>\n<h4 id=\"01JJSR6R044WBG58MKN9PX5VGG\"><strong>FOR MORE INFORMATION</strong></h4>\n<p class=\"p1\">For current system status information about Zendesk and specific impacts to your account, visit our <a href=\"https://status.zendesk.com\">system status page</a>.

They can enforce specific language, avoid certain phrases, or ensure key information is included in replies.</p>\n<p>What instructions can’t do, however, is fundamentally change the content returned by UltimateGPT. For example, instructions cannot be used to search a different knowledge source or to cause an escalation.</p>\n<p>Instructions are applied after UltimateGPT has understood the end user’s message, queried a knowledge source accordingly, and generated an answer ready to be sent back to the end user. At this point in the process, instructions can be used to shape—but not fundamentally change—the way that answer is presented to the end user.</p>\n<h3 id=\"h_01JJPSKMM2MGGXZRNE1QSBHX0F\">Be clear and direct</h3>\n<p>When crafting instructions, clarity is key. Use straightforward language and direct commands.</p>\n<p>For example, instead of saying:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\"I want the AI to always use our brand name.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Say this instead:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\"ALWAYS use 'Acme Labs™' instead of 'Acme.'\"</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A direct approach helps the AI understand and implement your instructions more effectively.</p>\n<p>That said, expect your instructions and tone of voice settings to be interpreted as strong guidance rather than rigid commands. Due to the way generative AI works, your AI agents might not execute every instruction perfectly every time, so it’s important to maintain realistic expectations about their performance.</p>\n<h3 id=\"h_01JJPSKR1R9D6T81105C4DEWSA\">Use capitalization for emphasis</h3>\n<p>When you want to stress certain behaviors in your instructions, using capitalization can be effective.</p>\n<p>For example, instructing the AI agent to \"ALWAYS include a link\" will highlight the importance of that directive.</p>\n<h3 id=\"h_01JJPSKYHHDZQK4PECN66HEWDY\">Create one instruction per directive</h3>\n<p>Instead of including multiple directives in a single instruction, break them down into separate instructions. Ensure that each instruction contains no more than a single directive. This approach:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Enhances the likelihood that the AI agent will respect your instructions.</li>\n<li>Makes it easier for you to edit and manage instructions over time.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"h_01JJPSM1306HT8CJGB4NXDRXTM\">Avoid conflicting instructions</h3>\n<p>Ensure that your instructions don’t contradict each other. For example, don’t write an instruction that says to end all messages with a smiley face if you have another instruction that says not to use emojis.</p>\n<p>Also, make sure your instructions don’t conflict with your chosen tone of voice. For example, if you <a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/8357758773658\">configured the AI agent’s tone of voice</a> to be friendly and casual, avoid instructions that suggest overly formal or abrupt responses. Consistency in messaging is crucial for a seamless customer experience.</p>\n<h3 id=\"h_01JJPSM37P7KR5GV82SH06GGSW\">Use existing features appropriately</h3>\n<p>Remember that instructions are not a substitute for other features. For specific tasks like <a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/8357756557594\">defining a welcome message</a>, <a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/8357758773658-Customizing-the-Persona-and-Tone-of-Voice-for-Your-AI-Agent-EAP-Ultimate#:~:text=Click%20the-,Tone%20of%20Voice,-tab%20and%20fill\">setting the default tone of voice</a>, or <a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/8357758773658-Customizing-the-Persona-and-Tone-of-Voice-for-Your-AI-Agent-EAP-Ultimate#:~:text=On%20the-,Pronoun%20Formality,-tab%2C%20select%20either\">setting pronoun formality for supported languages</a>, use the designated features instead of relying on instructions.</p>\n<p>In particular, take full advantage of the available <a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/8357758773658\">persona and tone of voice settings</a>. These features help define how your AI agent interacts with customers, enhancing the overall user experience.</p>\n<h3 id=\"h_01JJPSM60AD1ECGD7D6352EW8B\">Always test your instructions</h3>\n<p>Before making any instruction active, <a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/8357749291290-Using-instructions-to-influence-AI-agent-responses-EAP-Ultimate#h_01J9PBB7EYNE7C3J8FS4E49ERM:~:text=To%20test%20an%20individual%20instruction\">test the individual instruction</a> and <a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/8357749291290-Using-instructions-to-influence-AI-agent-responses-EAP-Ultimate#h_01J9PBB7EYNE7C3J8FS4E49ERM:~:text=To%20test%20multiple%20instructions%20together\">test all your instructions together</a> to see how the AI agent responds. Testing helps you identify any issues with wording or clarity. If an instruction doesn’t yield the expected outcome, try rephrasing it. The wording of an instruction plays a significant role in determining how an AI agent responds.</p>\n<p>After deploying your AI agent, continue to monitor its interactions with end users. If certain instructions aren’t performing as expected, revisit and tweak them. The AI agent’s effectiveness can improve over time with careful adjustments based on real-world usage.</p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01JJPSMENDQ9W10R44AAABENGA\">Examples of good and bad instructions</h2>\n<p>Below are examples of instructions, some good and some bad. Each example also includes an analysis of how following or ignoring the best practices above impact the instruction’s effectiveness.</p>\n<h3 id=\"h_01JJPSMHDD1KESXX4CKJCY4A76\">Good instructions</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Example</strong>: If the user asks any questions about how we are regulated, then send the following response verbatim: “Thank you for reaching out to us. Please see our regulatory information at https://help-centre-link.com/regulation.”<br>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Why it’s good</strong>: Clear and direct.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Example</strong>: ALWAYS say “Enjoy your flight!” at the end of your message<br>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Why it’s good</strong>: Uses capitalization for emphasis.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Example</strong>: When your answer is a list of step-by-step instructions, always list them as 1, 2, 3 regardless of the formatting of the source.<br>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Why it’s good</strong>: Clear and direct.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Example</strong>: At FinanceCo, we cannot offer any financial advice ever. Make sure you NEVER give the user financial advice of any kind. If you think an answer could be construed as financial advice, make sure to add a disclaimer at the beginning that says “Please note, we cannot provide financial advice.” followed by a new paragraph.<br>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Why it’s good</strong>: Uses capitalization for emphasis. Though note that, as mentioned above, instructions cannot be 100% foolproof, so expect some potential instances of the AI agent not including the disclaimer when you might want it to.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"h_01JJPSMPXZPNMK944MWM0ABAQC\">Bad instructions</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Example</strong>: You can use emojis, but only if they are more likely to be appropriate than not. Decide yourself.<br>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Why it’s bad</strong>: The language is too vague and leaves too much up to interpretation.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Example</strong>: Always welcome the user.<br>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Why it’s bad</strong>: This conflicts with the <a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/8357756557594\">welcome message feature</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Example</strong>: Always escalate to an agent if the user mentions being hacked.<br>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Why it’s bad</strong>: Instructions cannot trigger escalations. This should be handled via a <a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/8357733365402\">use case</a> instead.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"h_01JJPSMWD3R2RFV1P9FD9KDANA\">Best practices for customizing a tone of voice</h2>\n<p>You can also consider a custom tone of voice to be a kind of instruction, just directed at one specific aspect of your AI agent. You'll see best results if your custom tone of voice is as descriptive as possible, potentially with suggestions of the types of phrases or emojis that the AI agent should use.</p>\n<p>As with instructions, be direct about what the AI agent should do. Consider a wide range of scenarios and whether the tone of voice will suit them all. For example, an AI agent that has been instructed to always be cheery and lighthearted might not provide the best answer to a user who is complaining they've been doxxed.</p>\n<h3 id=\"h_01JJPSMYPG0F0XAZVNV306SR2T\">Example of a custom tone of voice</h3>\n<p>Below is an example of a custom tone of voice that is descriptive and contains examples of specific phrases and emojis.</p>\n<p><strong>Example</strong>: Respond to the user like Cher from the movie Clueless. Be super bubbly, confident, and a total valley girl. Use phrases like “As if!”, “Whatever!”, and “Totally!” Give responses in a fun, sassy, and fashionable way, with lots of enthusiasm and charm! Use one or two emojis per message. <img src=\"https://zen-marketing-documentation.s3.amazonaws.com/docs/en/emoji_manicure.png\"> <img src=\"https://zen-marketing-documentation.s3.amazonaws.com/docs/en/emoji_smile_closed.png\"></p><script id=\"article-banners-script\">\n        //<![CDATA[\n        const style = document.createElement('style');\n        style.innerHTML = `#styled-article-body{padding:1rem 0 0}#article-body #docs-wmp-link{text-align:right;font-size:.8em}#article-body .article-banners{margin-bottom:1rem}#article-body .article-banner{border:1px solid #ded7ca;background-color:#f6f0e6;margin:0 0 3px;line-height:1}#article-body .article-banner table{border-collapse:collapse;border:none;margin:0;width:auto}#article-body .article-banner td{padding:8px 6px 8px;border:none;font-size:.85em}#article-body .article-banner td:nth-child(2){border-left:1px solid #d0c9bd}#article-body .article-banner strong{font-weight:400;text-shadow:0 0 1px rgba(0,0,0,.5);letter-spacing:.5px}@media (min-width:1600px){#article-body .article-banner td{font-size:.8em}#article-body .docs-wmp-link{font-size:.7em}}`;\n        document.head.appendChild(style);\n        //]]>\n        </script>",

Thank you for your patience during this time. Our team will continue to monitor our systems closely to ensure everything runs smoothly. We appreciate your support and are here for any questions or feedback you may have!</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>January 13, 2025 11:51 AM UTC | January 13, 2025 03:51 AM PT </strong><br>We are investigating issues with Messaging Triggers executing for our customers on POD17.</p>\n</div>\n<p class=\"undefined\"><strong><br>POST-MORTEM</strong></p>\n<h4 id=\"h_01JJSSMS5Z6T6VTXN4ES2VAC1W\"><span style=\"color: #666666;\">Root Cause Analysis</span></h4>\n<p>This incident was caused by premature terminations of consumers for the Messaging ticket log events service, which occurred while the service was still running. As a result, the consumers were unable to process incoming events, leading to a complete halt in the evaluation and execution of Messaging Triggers on Pod 17.<br><br></p>\n<h4 id=\"h_01JJSSMS5ZSKRJMGB7DWRESHDG\"><span style=\"color: #666666;\">Resolution</span></h4>\n<p>To resolve this issue, we identified the configuration error that set the maximum number of records to be processed in a single batch to 500 instead of the intended 250. By correcting this typo and reducing the max records value, we aimed to decrease the likelihood of consumer terminations due to timeout issues.<br><br></p>\n<h4 id=\"h_01JJSSMS5Z5CAZA40C7Q8J1X2G\"><span style=\"color: #666666;\">Remediation Items</span></h4>\n<ol>\n<li>Implement a health check to detect premature terminations of consumers.</li>\n<li>Create a monitor to track the number of running consumers.</li>\n<li>Establish a monitor to monitor stopped partitions for the Tessaging ticket log events consumer.</li>\n<li>Add a consumer lag status widget to the Messaging Trigger Service dashboard.</li>\n<li>Create a new metric to measure the time taken to process a batch of messages from the messaging ticket log events topic.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>These remediations are designed to enhance monitoring and prevent similar incidents in the future, ensuring the stability and reliability of the Messaging Trigger Service.</p>\n<h4 id=\"h_01JJSSGQ81P64W2XN7WNJHBR2W\"><strong><br>FOR MORE INFORMATION</strong></h4>\n<p class=\"p1\">For current system status information about Zendesk and specific impacts to your account, visit our <a href=\"https://status.zendesk.com\">system status page</a>.
