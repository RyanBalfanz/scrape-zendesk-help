Instead, only certain tasks within a feature may experience errors.</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #2f3941;\">No data will be lost due to this process, and service will resume seamlessly once the upgrade completes.</span></li>\n<li>\n<span style=\"color: #2f3941;\">Outside of the specific windows outlined in the table above, customers should not experience any service impact.</span><br><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"></span>\n</li>\n</ul><p><span style=\"color: #464646;\"><strong>What do customers have to do?</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"color: #2f3941;\">Customers are not required to take any action. Since Zendesk features will be upgraded incrementally, only small portions of Zendesk’s capability will be offline at any given time. Here are some important points to keep in mind:</span></p><ul>\n<li><span style=\"color: #2f3941;\"><strong>Service availability</strong>: Zendesk products and services overall should remain active and functional throughout the maintenance period.</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #2f3941;\">Intermittent impact: While there may be multiple instances of brief errors, they will only affect specific tasks within features. Depending on the tasks a user attempts at specific times, it’s entirely possible to work through the entire window without experiencing any errors.</span></li>\n</ul><p><span style=\"color: #464646;\"><strong>Why we're doing this:</strong> </span></p><p>From time to time, Zendesk needs to perform upgrades to underlying database technologies used to power its services.

Now, admins can define granular access rules for each custom role's ability to create, read, update, and delete custom object records. Rules are defined for each action individually, so a single custom role could have different access rules applied to their permissions to create an object's records and update an object's record. </p><p>Record-level permissions make it possible for admins to protect sensitive information in custom objects and ensure it is surfaced to only the agents and end users who need to access it. For example, you might use access rules to configure the following use cases:</p><ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Assign an access rule to the end user's View permission</strong>: <br><em>Order &gt; Customer | matches | (current user)</em><br>Surface the signed-in customer's orders, contracts, accounts, etc. in the help center while ensuring that they can't see another customer's data, even through APIs.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Assign an access rule to level-1 agent's Edit permission</strong>: <br><em>Return &gt; Status | is not | Approved</em><br>Selective control for your agents to manage the business data in your custom objects under specific circumstances. For example, preventing more junior agents from modifying data, such as a return, after it's been approved by a more senior team member.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Assign an access rule to end user's Create and Edit permissions</strong>: <br><em>MyProduct &gt; Customer | matches | (current user)</em><br>Allows customers to create or edit custom object records related to them in a secure manner. For example, a user can register a product they purchase in their own name, but not for another user.</li>\n</ul><p>Access rules for custom object record permissions are available on Suite Team plans and above and Support Enterprise plans. On all of those plans, you can apply access rule permissions for customers. On Enterprise plans and above, you can also apply access rules to custom roles.</p><figure class=\"wysiwyg-image\"><img style=\"aspect-ratio: 1576/1172;\" src=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/9744667294234\" width=\"1576\" height=\"1172\"></figure><h2 id=\"h_01GD3S9GD63FPDGQSEFY88M3ND\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Why is Zendesk making this change?</span></h2><p>Zendesk understands that companies want to bring their unique business data into Zendesk custom objects, while keeping it secure and available to the appropriate end users and agents. Access rules make that possible. Additionally, agent leaders also need the ability to control which data agent roles can view and edit.</p><p>Record-level permissions make it possible for admins to control who sees and edits their business data, reducing the risk of data exposure and increasing data integrity.</p><h2 id=\"h_01GD3S9TSPXM7M4WHYKYF4E84M\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What do I need to do?</span></h2><p>Access rules are available to Zendesk Suite Team plans and above and Zendesk Support Enterprise plans and above. To leverage record-level permissions, update your custom objects to add and apply access rules. See <a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/9586292315290\">Refining custom object record permissions with access rules</a>.</p><p>You may also want to consider the following:</p><ul>\n<li>Switch away from using dynamic filtering within your lookup relationship fields to control which data is surfaced to end users, and instead implement access rule-based permissions for end users.</li>\n<li>Work with agent managers and team leads to determine the appropriate access-rule based permissions for agents in custom roles.</li>\n</ul><p>If you have feedback or questions related to this announcement, visit our <a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/community/topics\">community forum</a> where we collect and manage customer product feedback.

You need the Advanced AI add-on as part of your subscription to access the feature.</p><p>AI agents don't search live data or the internet in real time, instead import the information from other platforms and websites. Data is imported on a one-time or recurring basis. Supported sources include Zendesk, Salesforce, or Freshdesk help centers, CSV files, and content from public websites using a web crawler. You can add multiple knowledge sources to the same AI agent.</p><p>For community posts, manually extract the relevant content and convert it into a supported format, such as CSV, markdown, or plaintext. Once formatted, you can upload that content as a knowledge source to your AI agent.</p><p>The AI agent uses the imported information when generating its replies.

Clearly communicate this keyword to your recipients.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Opt-Out Link:</strong> Include a link in your messages that directs users to a webpage or mechanism where they can easily unsubscribe.</li>\n</ul><p>‍</p><p><strong>Important:</strong></p><p>‍</p><ul>\n<li>You must honor opt-out requests promptly and ensure that users who have opted out do not receive further messages from your business.</li>\n<li>It is recommended that you include a brief message in your initial communication informing recipients of how to opt out.</li>\n</ul><h2><strong>Repercussions of Non-Compliance</strong></h2><p>Failure to comply with WhatsApp for Business guidelines, especially those related to opt-out mechanisms, can result in severe consequences, including:</p><p>‍</p><ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Warnings: </strong>Warnings will be issued if the guidelines are not followed to allow you to rectify the situation.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Blocked Numbers: </strong>If the warnings are not adhered to in time, the numbers in question will be blocked from sending further messages.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Account Suspension:</strong> WhatsApp may suspend or even ban your business account if you are found to be violating their policies.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Damage to Reputation:</strong> Non-compliance can harm your business's reputation and erode customer trust.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Legal Action:</strong> In certain jurisdictions, you may face legal action for sending unsolicited messages.</li>\n</ul><h2><strong>Best Practices for Outbound Messaging</strong></h2><ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Obtain Consent:</strong> Whenever possible, obtain explicit consent from users before sending them WhatsApp messages.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Relevant and Valuable Content:</strong> Ensure that your messages are relevant and provide value to your recipients.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Respect Frequency:</strong> Avoid sending messages too frequently, as this can lead to user frustration and opt-outs.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Clear Communication:</strong> Clearly identify your business and the purpose of your message.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>WhatsApp Business Messaging Policy Update (November 2024):</strong> Businesses must obtain opt-in permission before messaging people on WhatsApp, which can be general and not specific to WhatsApp, as long as businesses comply with local laws. <a href=\"https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/overview/getting-opt-in\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Here</a> is a link for more information.</li>\n</ul><h2><strong>We're Here to Help</strong></h2><p>If you have any questions or concerns about compliance or best practices, please don't hesitate to reach out to our support team.</p><p>‍</p><p><strong>By following these guidelines, you can ensure a positive and compliant messaging experience for your clients while leveraging the power of WhatsApp for your business.</strong></p><p>References for additional information:</p><ul>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/overview/getting-opt-in\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/overview/getting-opt-in</a> </li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://business.whatsapp.com/policy\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://business.whatsapp.com/policy</a> </li>\n</ul>",

It can be positioned in different locations across the Engage platform and activated in multiple ways depending on an Agent’s actions.</div><h2>Why are Utilities important?</h2><p>Agents often need to use multiple applications to resolve a customer query. Switching between the applications is an inefficient process, leading to longer call times and lower customer satisfaction. </p><p>Utilities in Engage make it easier for Agents to get the information they need to assist a customer quicker and within the Engage application. This results in a better experience for both the Agent and the customer.</p><p>Utilities also ensure that when an Agent needs to perform additional tasks/actions (such as create a follow up task during a call), they can do it quickly and easily whilst remaining on the contact screen.</p><h2>Utility Types</h2><h3>iFrame Embed</h3><ul>\n<li>Display 3rd party applications within Engage, based on the configuration of the Utility and the relevant Workflow</li>\n<li>Enables an agent to read, write, or update data within the 3rd party application (based on their permission within the 3rd party application)</li>\n<li>Reduces the need for Agents to switch between multiple applications</li>\n<li>Ensures focus on the ongoing contact</li>\n</ul><h4>Example</h4><p>The example below shows an Agent using two Utilities:</p><ul>\n<li>Side Panel: An iFrame Embed Utility displaying a 3rd party booking application, enabling the Agent to book an appointment for the customer without navigating away from the contact</li>\n<li>Main Panel: An iFrame Embed Utility using a custom Google Map to display points of interest to the Agent, enabling the Agent to provide information (in this case a list of stations) to the customer without navigating away from the contact</li>\n</ul><div><img src=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/9731464089882\" alt=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\"></div><h3>Tasks</h3><ul>\n<li>Display Tasks within Engage, based on the configuration of the Utility and the relevant Workflow</li>\n<li>Enables the Agent to efficiently create follow-up Tasks whilst on a contact</li>\n<li>If you have previously utilised Tasks within Engage, you will notice that the functionality within Tasks has not changed with the introduction of Utilities</li>\n<li>Tasks within Utilities ensures Admins have greater control as to when and where Tasks appear to Agents</li>\n</ul><h4>Example</h4><p>The example below shows an Agent using a Task Utility:</p><ul>\n<li>The Task Utility is configured by the Admin and displays a form for the Agent to complete</li>\n<li>This example enables the Agent to quickly schedule a callback at the time specific by the customer</li>\n</ul><div><img src=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/9731464104346\" alt=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\"></div><p>To an Agent, all Utilities behave and appear in a similar fashion. They can all be configured to appear in either the Main or Side Panel within Engage, and can be made visible during a contact, in after call work, or both.<br>Once an Agent opens a Utility, the functionality within the Utility will be dependant on what the Admins have configured</p><h2>Other things to consider.</h2><p>Utilities are contact driven - they are only available to Agents whilst on a contact or in after call work (ACW). Utilities are designed to only display information to Agents if it is relevant to their ongoing contact or ACW. </p><p>As an example, a dashboard displaying metrics to an Agent is is not a recommended use case for a Utility.</p><p>‍</p>",

The new stack can safely be deployed without any impact on the existing stack. When ready, the Engage Account configuration can be changed to point to the new CloudFormation stack and the solution can be tested. Once everything is confirmed to be working, the old CloudFormation stack can safely be deleted. If any challenges are encountered during testing, the Engage Account configuration can again be changed to point to the old CloudFormation stack. This ensures that an operational environment can be maintained while any potential issues are investigated on the new CloudFormation stack.</p><p>‍</p>\n\n<div class=\"note note\">\n<strong>NB:</strong> Local Measure does not recommend that environments using email routing be upgraded without assistance from Local Measure.

      "body": "<p>For enhanced customer engagement and satisfaction, there are instances where agents require assistance during active calls or chats. This assistance can be automated using Connect Contact Lens, which can process voice streams and chat transcripts in real-time and respond to predefined scenarios set by contact centre managers.</p><p>For instance, if a customer expresses dissatisfaction about a delivery delay (the running example that we will use in this document), the system can swiftly detect this issue and provide agents with optimal instructions to placate the customer, reassuring them that the matter is being addressed. This capability can be extended to various specific requirements for notifying agents about Connect Contact Lens detections or suggestions.</p><p>In Engage, we support not only standard Connect Contact attributes but also Label/Panel/Button attributes. This document outlines the solution for applying these attributes along with Connect Contact Lens to automatically assist and notify agents.</p><h2 id=\"h_01K5M8Z14XPRQCC3RE9TZJ3ZCY\">Contact Attributes</h2><p>Standard attributes are excellent for providing agents with context about the contact they are managing. Engage provides Label and Panel attributes, which are essentially the standard contact attributes but presented with a distinctive and noticeable appearance.</p><p>These attributes can be tailored to use a variety of colour themes and icons. Label attributes (shown in orange in the sample figure below) are excellent for concise pieces of information like status updates. Panel attributes (displayed in blue in the sample figure below) are ideal for longer pieces of information that extend across multiple lines and need extra formatting.</p><div><img src=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/9731467555226\" alt=\"__wf_reserved_inherit\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\"></div><div class=\"note\">For comprehensive guidance on configuring label and panel attributes within Engage, we recommend consulting the following resources</div><ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/9696142331034\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Label attributes</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/9731475641498\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Panel attributes</a></li>\n</ul><h2 id=\"h_01K5M8Z14XN17XH9M02BXDW0V8\">Engage Button Attribute</h2><p>As depicted in the below sample figure (\"View Ticket\" and \"Some other action\" buttons), Engage also enables the creation of buttons that link to external URLs in new browser tabs.</p><ul>\n<li>You can have the freedom to create as many buttons as needed.</li>\n<li>These buttons will appear in Active Contacts and Historical.</li>\n<li>URLS are not validated by Engage.</li>\n<li>Clicking on links will open the link in a new tab.</li>\n</ul><div><img src=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/9731500411418\" alt=\"__wf_reserved_inherit\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\"></div><div class=\"note\">For more information, please refer to the section \"Button contact attributes\" in : <a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/9731466218650\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Displaying attributes to agents</a>\n</div><h2 id=\"h_01K5M8Z14XAS5AC1N0F5XRJ870\">Architecture</h2><p>To react to events published by Connect Contact Lens Rules, we need to deploy this solution in AWS. The overall solution architecture is illustrated below:</p><p>The steps include:</p><ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Create Connect Contact Lens Rule </strong>with an action type of publishing an EventBridge event. This rule is designed for real-time call/chat conditions, ensuring that contact attributes are promptly updated (near real-time) immediately after the rule is triggered by Connect Contact Lens.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Create a Lambda function</strong> to handle the actions, specifically updating the contact's Standard/Label/Panel attributes. This ensures that agents will see these updates in real-time in the middle of Engage.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Create an EventBridge rule </strong>with a target of the Lambda function.</li>\n</ol><p>By following these steps and deploying this architecture, updates to contact attributes will be handled swiftly and seamlessly, providing real-time insights for agents during engagement.</p><div><img src=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/9731439554714\" alt=\"__wf_reserved_inherit\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\"></div><p>‍</p><p>‍</p><p>‍</p><p>‍</p><h3 id=\"h_01K5M8Z14X1CR1Z4X2KMJBF6PF\">Create Connect Contact Lens Rule</h3><ol>\n<li>Navigate to the Rules section under Contact Lens, under the Analytics and Optimization Menu.</li>\n<li>Click on \"Create a rule\".</li>\n<li>Choose \"Conversational analytics\".</li>\n<li>In the \"When\" dropdown, choose \"A contact lens real-time call (or chat) analysis is available\".
