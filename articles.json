Assign your teams to the outward and inward-facing functions they serve and keep data in the right hands.  </p>\n<p>Zendesk has offered brands as a way of presenting multiple outward-facing identities to your customers for many years. Department Spaces now allows you to control internal access to the divisions of your company, making your Zendesk configuration a true enterprise solution.</p>\n<div class=\"p\">\n<div class=\"note note\">\n<span class=\"notetitle\">Note:</span> Department Spaces cannot be used with legacy Chat. If you'd like to use it with omnichannel routing, messaging, or Talk, a <a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/8125262923802\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">special configuration is required</a>.</div>\n</div>\n<p>This announcement includes the following sections: </p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#h_01JBA1ZX0WNTV48WRBZA4346RH\">What is changing?</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#h_01JBA2220W8RQ1B68H2Z2V2HK2\">Why is Zendesk making this change?</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#h_01JBA23XTQXDYC62YZK4PX5G0K\">What do I need to do?</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"h_01JBA1ZX0WNTV48WRBZA4346RH\">What is changing?</h2>\n<p>Department Spaces use the <em>brands</em> objects found within Zendesk today, and we’ll be incrementally changing the naming to reflect the move to <em>departments</em>. </p>\n<p>This feature allows agents to belong to specific departments, <a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/7584022494874\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">determining their ticket access</a>. Department Spaces is for customers with complex organizations and for managing Employee Service, enabling partitioned data access for multiple departments or brands within one instance. Departments can be used to partition brands, regions, internal functions, or lines of business.</p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01JBA2220W8RQ1B68H2Z2V2HK2\">Why is Zendesk making this change?</h2>\n<p>We are implementing these changes to address the need for granular data access controls within a single instance and the challenge of managing multiple instances. These changes allow for enhanced scalability within our product, allowing customers to partition ticket access based on agent membership in departments.</p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01JBA23XTQXDYC62YZK4PX5G0K\">What do I need to do?</h2>\n<p>No action is required to use Department Spaces. Ticket access will remain the same if you do nothing to team member membership.</p>\n<p>If you currently use Chat, messaging, or Talk, do not use Department Spaces. All team members must be members of all brands.</p>\n<p>If you have omnichannel routing turned on, <a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/8125262923802\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">we do not recommend using Department Spaces</a>. Omnichannel routing is not compatible with team member brand membership, and tickets may not get routed appropriately.</p>\n<p>We are working on ensuring omnichannel routing, Talk, messaging, and Chat all working with Department Spaces in the near future.</p>\n<p>To access these new features, customers must be on a Support or Suite Enterprise plan. Additionally, customers will need to <a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/7584022494874#topic_p4k_grx_xbc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">remove team members from departments</a> if they’d like to restrict access to certain tickets. Administrators can now assign team members to specific brands, limiting their access to tickets outside of their assigned brand unless explicitly added via CC.</p>\n<p>Thank you for your attention to these important updates as we continue to enhance the Zendesk experience for our customers.</p>\n<p>If you have feedback or questions related to this announcement, visit our <a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/community/topics/4408860477850\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">community forum</a> where we collect and manage customer product feedback.

The dataset that you need to use depends on your goal:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#h_01JB9S2AWC3VBC79701V4Y96KD\"> Omnichannel - Agent productivity</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#h_01JB9S5CS6AFHNHWM2QX3H49TG\">Omnichannel - Agent state</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#h_01JB9S6YWGC17AXHVR7ZZR2HGJ\">Omnichannel - Agent state daily</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"h_01JB9S2AWC3VBC79701V4Y96KD\">Agent productivity dataset</h2>\n<p>This dataset focuses on the work offered and assigned to agents. It details how agents use their capacity, such as number of tickets handled or response times.</p>\n<p>Use this dataset when you want to analyze how well agents manage their workloads and productivity levels, or to assess agents' performance based on the number of tasks completed and capacity.</p>\n<h3 id=\"h_01JBC9NEKAAJ2DJ550HEA7PJSE\">Example use case: I want to evaluate how effectively agents handle their workload</h3>\n<p>Analyze how many tickets each agent resolves in a given period, compare that to their available time, and identify top performers or those who may need additional training or support.</p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01JB9S5CS6AFHNHWM2QX3H49TG\">Agent state dataset</h2>\n<p>This dataset tracks how long agents spend in different states, such as <strong>Online</strong>, <strong>Away</strong>, <strong>Transfer</strong> <strong>Only</strong>, <strong>Invisible</strong>, and <strong>Offline</strong>. It records state changes with timestamps.</p>\n<p>Use this dataset when you need detailed insights into individual agent behavior and specific timing of state changes, to understand agent availability and patterns during peak times.</p>\n<h3 id=\"h_01JBC9VXQV06N87J67R40G354J\">Example use case: I want to manage staffing more effectively</h3>\n<p>Analyze how often agents switch between the status <strong>Online</strong> and <strong>Away</strong> during a busy period. This allows you to identify time frames when agents aren't available and correlate this data with call volumes or ticket inflow.</p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01JB9S6YWGC17AXHVR7ZZR2HGJ\">Agent state daily dataset</h2>\n<p>This dataset provides aggregated information summarized on a daily basis about how groups and agents spend their time across channels.</p>\n<p>Use this dataset to get an aggregated overview of agent performance across days and track general trends in agent behavior.</p>\n<h3 id=\"h_01JBCA6G3RJ9G5MSGBVCK4RQSK\">Example use case: I want to quickly see trends in agent availability or inactivity</h3>\n<p>Build a high-level overview of agent performance over a week, without the need to analyze detailed timestamps.</p>\n<p>For more information, see these articles:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/5600290657434-Metrics-and-attributes-for-agent-state-and-activity\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Metrics and attributes for agent state and activity</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408839218842-Understanding-datasets\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Understanding datasets</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/6362240787226-Why-is-the-per-channel-agent-status-time-different-than-the-unified-agent-status-time\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Why is the per-channel agent status time different than the unified agent status time?</a></li>\n</ul>",

However, developers who are either creating a new bundle or updating an existing ZIS bundle must make sure to eliminate any references to an OAuth access token reference path. Instead, use the <code>connectionName</code> property to refer to the connection in your custom action definitions.

To ensure that the widget remains open after a user expands it, even after reloading the page, you can implement this custom JavaScript:</p>\n<pre>**Enter your messaging widget code here**<br>&lt;script&gt;<br>window.zE || (function (e, t) {<br>var n = window.zE = function () {<br>n._.push(arguments);<br>};<br>n._ = [];<br>n.set = function (e, t) {<br>n._.push([\"set\", e, t]);<br>};<br>var r = document.createElement(\"script\");<br>r.type = \"text/javascript\";<br>r.async = true;<br>r.src = \"INSERT LINK FROM THE MESSAGING WIDGET CODE\";<br>var a = document.getElementsByTagName(\"script\")[0];<br>a.parentNode.insertBefore(r, a);<br>})();<br>// Check local storage for the widget state<br>document.addEventListener(\"DOMContentLoaded\", function () {<br>const widgetState = localStorage.getItem('zendeskWidgetState');<br>if (widgetState === 'open') {<br>zE('webWidget', 'open');<br>}<br>// Listen for widget open/close events<br>zE('webWidget:on', 'open', function () {<br>localStorage.setItem('zendeskWidgetState', 'open');<br>});<br>zE('webWidget:on', 'close', function () {<br>localStorage.setItem('zendeskWidgetState', 'minimized');<br>});<br>});<br>&lt;/script&gt;</pre>\n<div class=\"note note\">\n<span class=\"notetitle\"><strong>Disclaimer</strong>:</span> This article is provided for instructional purposes only.

You'll now experience better precision in similar ticket recommendations, along with more recommendations overall.<br>This announcement includes the following topics:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#h_01JAWXJ2GB1VH0RTAB79SFCGAM\">What’s changing?</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#h_01JAWXJFXG821CKH748RAP10Z6\">Why is Zendesk making this change?</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#h_01JAWXJMP4382CP8913FAZFWRJ\">What do I need to do?</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"h_01JAWXJ2GB1VH0RTAB79SFCGAM\">What's changing?</h2>\n<p>The similar tickets feature, currently in an early access program (EAP), has already garnered strong interest. The improvements in the recommendations' precision and the increase in overall number of recommendations were achieved by leveraging generative AI. We believe it will greatly enhance this feature's usefulness and adoption.</p>\n<p>Additionally, we've made the similar tickets feature available to more customers by removing the requirement to have the <a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4550640560538#topic_gpp_p4g_htb\">intent prediction type turned on</a>. This means that all customers with the <a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/5524125586330\">Advanced AI add-on</a> can now benefit from similar tickets without any extra setup.</p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01JAWXJFXG821CKH748RAP10Z6\">Why is Zendesk making this change?</h2>\n<p>Based on your feedback, we recognized two key areas needing improvement: the precision and availability of similar ticket recommendations. You often noticed similar tickets existed but weren't seeing enough of them. When they did appear, they sometimes weren't useful due to the complexity and unstructured nature of the ticket content.</p>\n<p>These enhancements are designed to support all agents across a wide range of tickets, from the simplest to the most complex, as well as from the most frequent to the rarest cases. Ultimately, we expect them to boost efficiency, reduce resolution times, and improve customer satisfaction.</p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01JAWXJMP4382CP8913FAZFWRJ\">What do I need to do?</h2>\n<p>If you've already <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScjMd9__L7RXEtZvS9IQLQz_3--OOZxam2FsIh2BX72lraFTA/viewform\">signed up for the similar tickets EAP</a> and <a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/8036381366426\">turned similar tickets on</a>, then no further action is necessary. This change will be automatically available after the rollout ends on October 28.</p>\n<p>If you have the Advanced AI add-on but haven't yet signed up for the EAP, you can <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScjMd9__L7RXEtZvS9IQLQz_3--OOZxam2FsIh2BX72lraFTA/viewform\">sign up for the EAP here</a>. For more information on using the feature, see <a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/6154115110170\">Finding tickets similar to the current ticket (EAP)</a>.</p>\n<p>If you’re interested in the Advanced AI add-on, see <a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/5715517808026-Buying-the-Advanced-AI-add-on\">Buying the Advanced AI add-on</a> or contact your Zendesk account representative.</p>\n<p>If you have feedback or questions related to this announcement, visit our <a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/community/topics/6447052855194\">community forum</a> where we collect and manage customer product feedback.

One reason is that the system may take time to update and reflect the available space.</p>\n<p>Not all tickets have attachments, so deleting those with few or none don't significantly free up space allocated to your files. To manage storage, look for tickets with large attachments, as deleting them will free up more space.</p>\n<p>For more information, read the article: <a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408885871130-How-can-I-remove-attachments-from-tickets\">How can I remove attachments from tickets?</a></p>",
