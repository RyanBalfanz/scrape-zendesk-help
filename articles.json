Now, admins can define granular access rules for each custom role's ability to create, read, update, and delete custom object records. Rules are defined for each action individually, so a single custom role could have different access rules applied to their permissions to create an object's records and update an object's record. </p><p>Record-level permissions make it possible for admins to protect sensitive information in custom objects and ensure it is surfaced to only the agents and end users who need to access it. For example, you might use access rules to configure the following use cases:</p><ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Assign an access rule to the end user's View permission</strong>: <br><em>Order &gt; Customer | matches | (current user)</em><br>Surface the signed-in customer's orders, contracts, accounts, etc. in the help center while ensuring that they can't see another customer's data, even through APIs.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Assign an access rule to level-1 agent's Edit permission</strong>: <br><em>Return &gt; Status | is not | Approved</em><br>Selective control for your agents to manage the business data in your custom objects under specific circumstances. For example, preventing more junior agents from modifying data, such as a return, after it's been approved by a more senior team member.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Assign an access rule to end user's Create and Edit permissions</strong>: <br><em>MyProduct &gt; Customer | matches | (current user)</em><br>Allows customers to create or edit custom object records related to them in a secure manner. For example, a user can register a product they purchase in their own name, but not for another user.</li>\n</ul><p>Access rules for custom object record permissions are available on Suite Team plans and above and Support Enterprise plans. On all of those plans, you can apply access rule permissions for customers. On Enterprise plans and above, you can also apply access rules to custom roles.</p><figure class=\"wysiwyg-image\"><img style=\"aspect-ratio: 1576/1172;\" src=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/9744667294234\" width=\"1576\" height=\"1172\"></figure><h2 id=\"h_01GD3S9GD63FPDGQSEFY88M3ND\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Why is Zendesk making this change?</span></h2><p>Zendesk understands that companies want to bring their unique business data into Zendesk custom objects, while keeping it secure and available to the appropriate end users and agents. Access rules make that possible. Additionally, agent leaders also need the ability to control which data agent roles can view and edit.</p><p>Record-level permissions make it possible for admins to control who sees and edits their business data, reducing the risk of data exposure and increasing data integrity.</p><h2 id=\"h_01GD3S9TSPXM7M4WHYKYF4E84M\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What do I need to do?</span></h2><p>Access rules are available to Zendesk Suite Team plans and above and Zendesk Support Enterprise plans and above. To leverage record-level permissions, update your custom objects to add and apply access rules. See <a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/9586292315290\">Refining custom object record permissions with access rules</a>.</p><p>You may also want to consider the following:</p><ul>\n<li>Switch away from using dynamic filtering within your lookup relationship fields to control which data is surfaced to end users, and instead implement access rule-based permissions for end users.</li>\n<li>Work with agent managers and team leads to determine the appropriate access-rule based permissions for agents in custom roles.</li>\n</ul><p>If you have feedback or questions related to this announcement, visit our <a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/community/topics\">community forum</a> where we collect and manage customer product feedback.

You need the Advanced AI add-on as part of your subscription to access the feature.</p><p>AI agents don't search live data or the internet in real time, instead import the information from other platforms and websites. Data is imported on a one-time or recurring basis. Supported sources include Zendesk, Salesforce, or Freshdesk help centers, CSV files, and content from public websites using a web crawler. You can add multiple knowledge sources to the same AI agent.</p><p>For community posts, manually extract the relevant content and convert it into a supported format, such as CSV, markdown, or plaintext. Once formatted, you can upload that content as a knowledge source to your AI agent.</p><p>The AI agent uses the imported information when generating its replies. For more information, see the article: <a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/8357749301658-Importing-knowledge-sources-for-an-advanced-AI-agent\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Importing knowledge sources for an advanced AI agent</a>.</p>",

Clearly communicate this keyword to your recipients.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Opt-Out Link:</strong> Include a link in your messages that directs users to a webpage or mechanism where they can easily unsubscribe.</li>\n</ul><p>‍</p><p><strong>Important:</strong></p><p>‍</p><ul>\n<li>You must honor opt-out requests promptly and ensure that users who have opted out do not receive further messages from your business.</li>\n<li>It is recommended that you include a brief message in your initial communication informing recipients of how to opt out.</li>\n</ul><h2><strong>Repercussions of Non-Compliance</strong></h2><p>Failure to comply with WhatsApp for Business guidelines, especially those related to opt-out mechanisms, can result in severe consequences, including:</p><p>‍</p><ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Warnings: </strong>Warnings will be issued if the guidelines are not followed to allow you to rectify the situation.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Blocked Numbers: </strong>If the warnings are not adhered to in time, the numbers in question will be blocked from sending further messages.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Account Suspension:</strong> WhatsApp may suspend or even ban your business account if you are found to be violating their policies.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Damage to Reputation:</strong> Non-compliance can harm your business's reputation and erode customer trust.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Legal Action:</strong> In certain jurisdictions, you may face legal action for sending unsolicited messages.</li>\n</ul><h2><strong>Best Practices for Outbound Messaging</strong></h2><ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Obtain Consent:</strong> Whenever possible, obtain explicit consent from users before sending them WhatsApp messages.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Relevant and Valuable Content:</strong> Ensure that your messages are relevant and provide value to your recipients.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Respect Frequency:</strong> Avoid sending messages too frequently, as this can lead to user frustration and opt-outs.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Clear Communication:</strong> Clearly identify your business and the purpose of your message.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>WhatsApp Business Messaging Policy Update (November 2024):</strong> Businesses must obtain opt-in permission before messaging people on WhatsApp, which can be general and not specific to WhatsApp, as long as businesses comply with local laws. <a href=\"https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/overview/getting-opt-in\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Here</a> is a link for more information.</li>\n</ul><h2><strong>We're Here to Help</strong></h2><p>If you have any questions or concerns about compliance or best practices, please don't hesitate to reach out to our support team.</p><p>‍</p><p><strong>By following these guidelines, you can ensure a positive and compliant messaging experience for your clients while leveraging the power of WhatsApp for your business.</strong></p><p>References for additional information:</p><ul>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/overview/getting-opt-in\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/overview/getting-opt-in</a> </li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://business.whatsapp.com/policy\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://business.whatsapp.com/policy</a> </li>\n</ul>",

It can be positioned in different locations across the Engage platform and activated in multiple ways depending on an Agent’s actions.</div><h2>Why are Utilities important?</h2><p>Agents often need to use multiple applications to resolve a customer query. Switching between the applications is an inefficient process, leading to longer call times and lower customer satisfaction. </p><p>Utilities in Engage make it easier for Agents to get the information they need to assist a customer quicker and within the Engage application. This results in a better experience for both the Agent and the customer.</p><p>Utilities also ensure that when an Agent needs to perform additional tasks/actions (such as create a follow up task during a call), they can do it quickly and easily whilst remaining on the contact screen.</p><h2>Utility Types</h2><h3>iFrame Embed</h3><ul>\n<li>Display 3rd party applications within Engage, based on the configuration of the Utility and the relevant Workflow</li>\n<li>Enables an agent to read, write, or update data within the 3rd party application (based on their permission within the 3rd party application)</li>\n<li>Reduces the need for Agents to switch between multiple applications</li>\n<li>Ensures focus on the ongoing contact</li>\n</ul><h4>Example</h4><p>The example below shows an Agent using two Utilities:</p><ul>\n<li>Side Panel: An iFrame Embed Utility displaying a 3rd party booking application, enabling the Agent to book an appointment for the customer without navigating away from the contact</li>\n<li>Main Panel: An iFrame Embed Utility using a custom Google Map to display points of interest to the Agent, enabling the Agent to provide information (in this case a list of stations) to the customer without navigating away from the contact</li>\n</ul><div><img src=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/9731464089882\" alt=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\"></div><h3>Tasks</h3><ul>\n<li>Display Tasks within Engage, based on the configuration of the Utility and the relevant Workflow</li>\n<li>Enables the Agent to efficiently create follow-up Tasks whilst on a contact</li>\n<li>If you have previously utilised Tasks within Engage, you will notice that the functionality within Tasks has not changed with the introduction of Utilities</li>\n<li>Tasks within Utilities ensures Admins have greater control as to when and where Tasks appear to Agents</li>\n</ul><h4>Example</h4><p>The example below shows an Agent using a Task Utility:</p><ul>\n<li>The Task Utility is configured by the Admin and displays a form for the Agent to complete</li>\n<li>This example enables the Agent to quickly schedule a callback at the time specific by the customer</li>\n</ul><div><img src=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/9731464104346\" alt=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\"></div><p>To an Agent, all Utilities behave and appear in a similar fashion. They can all be configured to appear in either the Main or Side Panel within Engage, and can be made visible during a contact, in after call work, or both.<br>Once an Agent opens a Utility, the functionality within the Utility will be dependant on what the Admins have configured</p><h2>Other things to consider.</h2><p>Utilities are contact driven - they are only available to Agents whilst on a contact or in after call work (ACW). Utilities are designed to only display information to Agents if it is relevant to their ongoing contact or ACW. </p><p>As an example, a dashboard displaying metrics to an Agent is is not a recommended use case for a Utility.</p><p>‍</p>",

The new stack can safely be deployed without any impact on the existing stack. When ready, the Engage Account configuration can be changed to point to the new CloudFormation stack and the solution can be tested. Once everything is confirmed to be working, the old CloudFormation stack can safely be deleted. If any challenges are encountered during testing, the Engage Account configuration can again be changed to point to the old CloudFormation stack. This ensures that an operational environment can be maintained while any potential issues are investigated on the new CloudFormation stack.</p><p>‍</p>\n\n<div class=\"note note\">\n<strong>NB:</strong> Local Measure does not recommend that environments using email routing be upgraded without assistance from Local Measure.

This ensures that agents will see these updates in real-time in the middle of Engage.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Create an EventBridge rule </strong>with a target of the Lambda function.</li>\n</ol><p>By following these steps and deploying this architecture, updates to contact attributes will be handled swiftly and seamlessly, providing real-time insights for agents during engagement.</p><div><img src=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/9731439554714\" alt=\"__wf_reserved_inherit\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\"></div><p>‍</p><p>‍</p><p>‍</p><p>‍</p><h3 id=\"h_01K5M8Z14X1CR1Z4X2KMJBF6PF\">Create Connect Contact Lens Rule</h3><ol>\n<li>Navigate to the Rules section under Contact Lens, under the Analytics and Optimization Menu.</li>\n<li>Click on \"Create a rule\".</li>\n<li>Choose \"Conversational analytics\".</li>\n<li>In the \"When\" dropdown, choose \"A contact lens real-time call (or chat) analysis is available\".

      "body": "<p>In this guide, we'll break down the essentials of making outbound calls and using key features, from the basics like hold and mute, to advanced moves like warm transfers and conference calls. It's a mix of the fundamentals and some handy tips, perfect for both newcomers and those familiar with the system.</p>\n\n<h2>Making an outbound call</h2><p>You can start making outbound calls by clicking on the 📞<strong>Outbound Call</strong> button next to the status icon. </p><div><img src=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/9731476428826\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\"></div><p>If you are calling a customer that has had previous interactions within the system or if you are using your internal CRM, the customer information will be displayed in the Customer Profile section on the right-hand side of the screen once the call is connected. </p><p>A timer will appear next to the contact to show you how much time has elapsed on the call.</p><h2>Using the Hold and Mute functions</h2><p>During a call, you may need to put a customer on hold or mute yourself. </p><p>To put a customer on hold, simply click the dark gray <strong>Hold ⏸️ </strong>button above the conversation tab, and you'll receive a verbal notification that the customer is on hold, and the button will turn orange. </p><div><img src=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/9731450947866\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\"></div><p>To resume the call, click the same button, which will now be orange and labeled <strong>Resume</strong>. </p><p>Similarly, to mute yourself, click the dark gray <strong>Mute </strong>button above the conversation tab, and to unmute, click the same button, which will now be orange and labeled <strong>Un-mute</strong>.</p><h2>Internal transfer notes</h2><p>To add an internal transfer note before transferring a caller, click the <strong>note 🗒 </strong>button located at the bottom of the conversation box and start typing your note. Alternatively, you can type your note during the transfer process. </p><div><img src=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/9731476471066\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\"></div><p>Click the green <strong>tick</strong> ✅ button to save your note to the customer’s profile.</p><div class=\"note note\">Note: If you add a note after transferring the call, the person/team that you transferred the call to won't see the note. Be sure to add the note before transferring the caller.</div><h2>Transferring calls</h2><p>When you need to transfer a call, click on the <strong>Transfer</strong> button at the top of the screen, which will put you on hold while the transfer occurs. </p><div><img src=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/9731476483354\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\"></div><p>You can transfer to an individual person listed in Quick Connects or to another number. After selecting the person or number, click the Transfer button to initiate the transfer. </p><p>Once the call is transferred, you can add a note before closing the contact. </p><p>If you need to cancel the transfer, you can simply click the <strong>Cancel</strong> button.</p><h2>Cold transfer</h2><p>After a transfer is initiated, to make a cold transfer, click on the red <strong>x</strong> button next to the customer’s number . This will automatically put you in After Call Work (<strong>ACW</strong>) and the customer will be in queue with the third-party.</p><div><img src=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/9731476495002\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\"></div><h2>Warm transfer</h2><p>To perform a warm transfer, initiate the transfer and wait for the third-party to answer. While waiting, the customer will be placed on hold and will not be able to hear your conversation with the third-party.</p><div><img src=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/9731476495002\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\"></div><p>Once the third-party answers, you have two options: transfer the customer to the third-party or return to the customer after speaking with the third-party.</p><p>To transfer the customer to the third-party, click on the red <strong>x</strong> button next to the customer's number. This will place you in After Call Work (<strong>ACW</strong>) mode and the customer will be placed in queue with the third-party.</p><p>To return to the customer, click on the red <strong>x</strong> button next to the third-party's number or name.</p><h2>Conference call</h2><p>To start a conference call, initiate the transfer and <strong>wait until the third party answers</strong>. Once they accept the call, click on the <strong>Join</strong> button which will connect all parties.</p><div><img src=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/9731463934106\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\"></div><div class=\"note note\">If you click the Join button before the third party has answered the call, the system will return an error.</div><h2>Closing a call</h2><p>Once your conversation with the customer is complete you can end the call by clicking the red <strong>x</strong> button at the top of the conversation window. </p><div><img src=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/9731500427802\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\"></div><p>Your status will change to <strong>After Call Work</strong> and you will see the letters <strong>ACW</strong> appear in the top right corner of the screen.</p><div><img src=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/9731451016090\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\"></div><p>Use this time to add your notes and complete all after call work, then close the contact by clicking the <strong>Save and Close</strong> button. Remember to select a resolution code in order to close the contact.</p><p>Once the interaction is closed, your status will automatically change to <strong>Available</strong> once more. If you wish to go offline, change your status to <strong>Unavailable</strong> before closing the contact.</p><h2>Using Next Status</h2><p><strong>Agent Next</strong> status enables an agent to change into the state they want to be by the end of the call. This is particularly useful if you need to take a lunch break or quickly step away from your desk. </p><div><img src=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/9731451021594\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\"></div><p>You can select agent Next Status whilst you are on a call and speaking to a customer. You can set your next status, for example to be <strong>Offline</strong>.</p><p>Once you end the call and close your interaction, the system will automatically put you into <strong>Offline</strong> status thereby ensuring that you will not receive any further calls that may be waiting in the queue.</p><p>‍</p>",

Engage will use the messages from the customer and review the language in which they are sent. Agents can re-run the automatic detection at any time by clicking the refresh icon on the translation banner.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Manual Agent override</strong> - If the detected language seems incorrect, Agents have the option to manually select a language. They can do this by clicking on the language displayed in the translation banner and typing in the required language</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Manual attribute override</strong> - The language used can be set using a custom contact attribute. As an example, you can set the _LM_language attribute in a contact flow, using the locale code of the required language as the value. e.g. <code>{\"_LM_language\":\"fr-CA\"}</code>\n</li>\n</ol><div><img src=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/9731450917786\" alt=\"__wf_reserved_inherit\"></div><h3 id=\"h_01K5MGNNDVV39GPRB1B0J79K23\">Auditing Smart Translations</h3><p>For auditing purposes, a complete record of both the the original (non-translated) and translated messages are stored in an S3 bucket within your AWS environment. To access these, you can review the contents within your CTRs as well as ChatTranslations S3 bucket within your Connect directory.</p><p>‍</p><h3 id=\"h_01K5MGNNDVYNGK7F6X6CGK1M7R\">FAQs</h3><p>Q: Which languages are supported?</p><p>A: The languages supported depend on the model used to power Smart Translations. Neither Anthropic nor Open AI publish a list of supported languages for translations, however they are known to be proficient across a wide range of languages. Local Measure has performed testing in dozens of languages with great success. Specifically, Local Measure has tested English (US, AU, CA, GB), Dutch, French, Mandarin, Spanish, Portuguese, German (DE, AT, SU), Italian, Xhosa, Afrikaans and many more languages.</p><p>‍</p><p>Q: Will an End Customer know that the conversation is being translated?</p><p>A: Not by default. Local Measure recommends adding an automated message that is sent to the End Customer if they are on a queue that may use Smart Translations.</p><p>‍</p><p>Q: How will I be charged for Smart Translations?</p><p>A: There are 2 elements; the AI Service you choose to use, and Local Measure unit consumption. Note that unit consumption applies as soon as the language detection step within Smart Translations is performed. This means that 2 units will be added to the relevant contact even if language detection determines that there is no need for translation.</p><p>‍</p><p>Q: How does Smart Translations detect the End Customer's language?</p><p>A: Smart Translations uses the content from the first 5 messages an End Customer sends to determine their language.</p><p>‍</p><p>Q: Can I see Smart Translations in historical Contacts / Contact Search?</p><p>A: Yes, when viewing historical Contacts you will be able to see both the original and translated messages.</p>",
