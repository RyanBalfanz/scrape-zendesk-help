      "body": "<p> </p>\n<p>Recently, the Zendesk Community hosted our second Post-Relate Deep Dive on Zendesk AI Agents, \"the most autonomous bots in CX.\" Our expert panel delved into AI agents' core functionalities and showcased an interactive product demo. Attendees were shown best practices, real-world use cases, and received resources to enhance their service experiences with AI agents.</p>\n<p>The event highlighted AI agents' potential to improve automated resolution rates, elevate customer interactions, and boost operational efficiencies. The live Q&amp;A session provided personalized insights for participants. In this article, you'll find our event resources, a recording of the event, and a curated list of questions we addressed.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01J2J1JBEGN4H4873183H69Z3S\"><strong>Event Recording</strong></h2>\n<p><iframe src=\"//www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/-_Pb196p5ro\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01J2J2PYMG0K4GVHW24T575C64\"><strong>Q&amp;A Summary </strong></h2>\n<h4 id=\"h_01J2J3FBJ0WMM0ENT9KSCWQ9SQ\"><strong>What are some of the best ways to build out this functionality if you don't have a bot yet?</strong></h4>\n<p>Launch an AI agent in minutes &gt; Set guardrails with intents &gt; Add more personalization and control in your interactions &gt; Analyze and optimize your AI agent performance &gt; Automate your emails and web forms. We would recommend allowing a 2-week learning period post-deployment for your AI agent to recognize your customers’ conversation patterns. Opt for “generate a reply” for intents that are best resolved using your knowledge base. Consider utilizing this for FAQs that can be effectively addressed with info from your help center articles. Build conversation/answer flows to personalize your customer experience (eg check order status, authentication, or creating conditional scenarios).</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h4 id=\"h_01J2J6CM54QCF2N45SJTW865C4\"><strong>How do you measure the success of AI Agents?</strong></h4>\n<p>Start slowly and build as you go: Reach up to 20% automation rates just by using generative replies. Choose a couple of popular intents to use GenAI with, and every couple of days, continue to automate more intents. Review and adjust on an ongoing basis: Review AI agent conversation transcripts to identify knowledge or conversation gaps. Optimize your flows to ensure customers don’t need to repeat themselves.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h4 id=\"h_01J2J6CR0VVA5741DJ8QTTJFVC\"><strong>What metrics should I look at in my first month of rollout?</strong></h4>\n<p>Monitoring AI Agents is best done via the Insights dashboard. You can obtain detailed information about active users, the percentage of transfers to agents, and automated resolutions. The dashboard performance metrics offer you a quick glance at the overall performance of the AI Agents.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h4 id=\"h_01J2J3WYT8FCGTT21GJM3SCX9J\"><strong>How do I prevent the AI Agent from giving the wrong answer?<br></strong></h4>\n<p>The information your AI agent surfaces is only as good as the information within your knowledge base. Ensure that your KB content is up to date &amp; verified on a regular cadence to ensure no legacy answers are given. Focusing on the first 75 words leads to better article retrieval. Optimize your knowledge base by using tips from this article to make each article about a single topic rather than multiple issues.<br><br></p>\n<h4 id=\"01J2J3XXSH77E32AZTQH4DH1G5\"><strong>How do I get my AI Agent to prfill the ticket form to save time for the agent and increase efficiency?</strong></h4>\n<p>You'll want to leverage an \"ask for details\" step within \"ai agents\" settings to collect certain data points</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h4 id=\"01J2J41YYEVTP96P7J0MGW5QQ6\"><strong>What are the best KPI's to look at when determining success with AI Agents?</strong></h4>\n<p>We recommend the following: Self Service Rates. Where are you starting from? Bot Insights 7 Day Performance. \"Next Steps to Improve Performance\". Surfacing topics that are escalating into a ticket/unresolved. Actionable next steps on improving automation levels such as intent suggestions. Combine that with CSAT.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h4 id=\"01J2J46QZWZZ04PRR5T1GRSJZR\"><strong>Conversations just with bots are only historically available for 7 days. Is there any way to export or store this data? We would want it for quality assurance of the bot, to make sure it's giving the right info to customers.</strong></h4>\n<p>We are thrilled to announce the release of our AI agent QA (bot QA) feature, designed to enhance chatbot quality assurance. This new functionality allows you to identify blind spots in your AI agent support quality. Analyze and review 100% of your AI agent interactions, identify errors for human intervention, and gain insights into key performance areas.<br><strong>Resource: <a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/7423754224410-Announcing-quality-assurance-QA-for-AI-agents\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Announcing quality assurance (QA) for AI agents</a></strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<h4 id=\"01J2J48RPZKRW3KV33HB27ZHQQ\">\n<strong>Is there an obvious sign to the end-users that they are speaking to an AI agent?</strong><br><strong>If so, is it optional for them to elect to speak with an agent easily?</strong>\n</h4>\n<p>Yes, there is a indicator that the comments from the Ai agent are \"generated via Ai\" upon reply. Ai agents can be equipped to handoff to a live agent and understand when a user requests this.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h4 id=\"01J2J4S6NM5B77CHAJCYEAJ95E\"><strong>Do we need to use Sunshine for the AI Agent to access our customer data from our database?</strong></h4>\n<p>No, you can leverage the Make API call step in the Native AI Agent to collect the relevent customer data from your back end system, store, pass variables. and then return it in a BOT message within the Conversation without using Sunshine Conversations API access.<br><strong style=\"font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;\">Resource: <a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4572971586586-Using-the-Make-API-call-step-in-a-conversation-bot\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Using the Make API call step in a conversation bot</a><br></strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<h4 id=\"01J2J4VYJZ3K05R929MKMYS2M4\"><strong>Can the AI Agent integrate with HubSpot to create sales and marketing workflows from support tickets?</strong></h4>\n<p>The Make API call step allows you to configure an API call out to another system, such as an internal CRM or ERP, or to push conversation details to an external endpoint, like Amazon Event Bridge or Google Analytics. I have not worked directly with the HubSpot API, but assuming they have an API endpoint we could access, we could determine how to leverage within the AI Agent Bot Flow.<br><strong style=\"font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;\">Resource: <a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4572971586586-Using-the-Make-API-call-step-in-a-conversation-bot\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Using the Make API call step in a conversation bot</a><br></strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<h4 id=\"01J2J4XCG70P0ZFNRMQ18QQV4M\"><strong>Where is the information coming from to answer user's questions - Zendesk Guide articles? If so, how do we best prepare our knowledge base when we tend to have a lot of \"snowflake\" (one off) tickets?</strong></h4>\n<p>Correct, information is coming directly from your help center articles. That means you don't need to worry about your AI agents handing out inaccurate info that's out of left field -- because any info they give is something your teams have already written and approved in your help center. Our reporting should be able to help you identify themes among questions that are going unanswered by your AI agent. Using these insights, you can create help center articles to address these topics. I'd say to pay special attention to the title and first 75 words or so of your article, as those are very powerful for helping your AI agent surface the right information<br><br></p>\n<h4 id=\"01J2J4ZR1HJS2VV1B499RVSZ65\"><strong>What are some of the most challenging use-cases ZenDesk teams are seeing out there?</strong></h4>\n<p>Let's interpreting this question as meaning the most complex use cases that we see our customers solving using AI agents. We've seen customers find really great sucess with complex processes by using those end-to-end integrations. As a reminder, you can use these to push, pull, and parse data from all sorts of internal and external systems like your OMS, your CRM, your shipping provider. This has been transformative when it comes to automating processes that used to be a guaranteed ticket to a human agent. Now, things like returns or exchanges can be completely automated, which we know is a very complex process when it comes to all of the data required to finalize it.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h4 id=\"01J2J4ZR1HJS2VV1B499RVSZ65\"><strong>Do you have any suggestions for increasing adoption of chat bots for less tech savvy customers?</strong></h4>\n<p>Start with the basics, have content/ knowledge your ai agents can use. This will be the core foundation of how you can get immediate value with minimal setup!</p>\n<p><strong>Resource: <a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/6138268212634-Using-AI-to-generate-replies-in-a-conversation-bot\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Using AI to generate replies in a conversation bot</a><br></strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01J2J6CM541XK1W7V1Q5MJ7YXZ\"><strong>Event Resources<br></strong></h2>\n<ul>\n<li id=\"01J2J58F88EA2BP3EAGHGA1A9F\"><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1a0KxCKFK6arL00EJ0kHQGTRdNYLiKO1dM87JplA9sTY/edit?usp=sharing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>Event Presentation</strong></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1a0KxCKFK6arL00EJ0kHQGTRdNYLiKO1dM87JplA9sTY/edit?usp=sharing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>Community Council Application</strong></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://usergroups.zendesk.com/ai-user-group/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>AI User Group </strong></a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"01J2J57YM56GHSKK0AZWGQ59HK\"><strong> </strong></h2>",

This impacts customers who have migrated to the Omnichannel Backend Routing. In order to ensure your agent's names are sent in chat and messaging with only their intended alias you will need to perform the following actions:\n\n1. Set a Support alias in addition to your Chat display name\n2. Update Chat shortcuts to not use {{agent_name}}\n\nOur teams are reviewing this behavior and we will provide further updates as they become available.

For example, you could now create queries that return:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A list of assets assigned to users that aren't within warranty and contain the word \"laptop\"</li>\n<li>A list of product returns initiated by a specific user in the last 30 days that have a status of open or in progress</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"h_01GD3S9GD63FPDGQSEFY88M3ND\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Why is Zendesk making this change?</span></h2>\n<p>The filtered search endpoint creates the ability for Zendesk users and app developers to build intricate agent experiences with custom objects. This functionality, when paired with the soon-to-be-related end user permissions for custom objects, also means app developers can create customized end-user experiences with custom objects.</p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01GD3S9TSPXM7M4WHYKYF4E84M\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What do I need to do?</span></h2>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://developer.zendesk.com/api-reference/custom-data/custom-objects/custom_object_records/#filtered-search-of-custom-object-records\">filtered search endpoint</a> is available to all accounts eligible for custom objects.

Due to this conflict, the current user who tries to log in via JWT authentication can't be authenticated.</p>\n<p>For example, this error can occur when an existing Zendesk user with an external_ID 1234 was updated and the <code>external_ID</code> of the user changed, for example 123456. Both the user in Zendesk and the payload will have the same information, same email, and same external_ID. When trying to authenticate the user however, the email registered for that user will be linked to an <code>AppUserID</code> in Sunshine Conversation. Zendesk will only allow the authentication of the user with the previous external_ID, 1234.</p>\n<p>To resolve this behaviour and allow users with an updated <code>external_ID</code> to log in via JWT authentication, you must delete the previous <code>AppUserID</code> linked to the first <code>external_ID</code>.</p>\n<p>With Suite Professional and above plans, make an API call:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Basic authentication</strong>, use an <a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4576088682266-Using-the-Conversations-API-keys#:~:text=To%20create%20and%20share%20an,Click%20Create%20API%20key.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">API key and a secret key</a>.\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Username</strong>: <code>API_KEY_ID</code>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Password</strong>: <code>API_KEY_SECRET</code>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>API method</strong>: <code>DELETE</code>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>URL for European accounts</strong>: <code>https://api.eu-1.smooch.io/v2/apps/{appId}/users/{userIdOrExternalId}</code>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>URL for the rest of the world</strong>: <code>https://api.smooch.io/v2/apps/{appId}/users/{userIdOrExternalId}</code><br>Within the above URLs, replace the <code>{appId}</code> with the ID provided when generating the API key and secret key, and replace the <code>{userIdOrExternalId}</code> with the previous <code>external_ID</code> linked to the user who returns the error.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"p\">\n<div class=\"note note\">\n<span class=\"notetitle\"><strong>Disclaimer</strong>:</span> This article is provided for instructional purposes only.

This was due to a change in our system that inadvertently caused an error, impacting the availability of these recordings. Once the issue was identified, we reverted the change, restoring normal service.</p>\n<div id=\"message-list\">\n<h4 id=\"h_01J2DR6JA2R8R1HDQ4KDEFNF1S\" class=\"undefined\"><strong>Timeline<br></strong></h4>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>July 05, 2024 01:52 PM UTC | July 05, 2024 06:52 AM PT<br></strong>Changes were successfully reverted to the previous working state. Logs indicate that our recovery process is functioning and should recover recordings within the next couple of hours. Please allow time for the system to process any previously unavailable recordings. A simple page or browser refresh/update may be required. Thank you for your patience while we worked on this.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>July 05, 2024 01:31 PM UTC | July 05, 2024 06:31 AM PT </strong><br>We are currently aware of and working on reverting recent changes that have impacted Talk customers, causing “Call recordings” to be unavailable across multiple Pods. The next update will be provided in 30 minutes.</p>\n</div>\n<h3 id=\"h_01J2CE2M72E3KBZSRKQ9AN08GW\" class=\"p1\"><strong><br>POST-MORTEM</strong></h3>\n<h4 id=\"h_01J2DR3N4321MGQB6HDZ4BPCQ7\" class=\"undefined\"><strong>Root Cause Analysis</strong></h4>\n<p class=\"undefined\">The issue was caused by a change in our system configuration that affected how call recordings were stored. Specifically, a setting was altered that directed our service to an incorrect storage location, resulting in errors when trying to save call recordings.</p>\n<h4 id=\"h_01J2DR3R7PPAJVYF5N237D1H65\"><strong>Resolution</strong></h4>\n<p>Upon identifying the issue, we quickly reverted the change that caused the problem. This rollback restored the correct configuration, and our service resumed normal operation.</p>\n<h4 id=\"h_01J2DR3V87XN0SBMBJ3HJNK8B5\"><strong>Remediation</strong></h4>\n<p>To prevent this from happening again, we are taking the following steps:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Improved Testing: We will enhance our testing processes to catch similar issues before they reach production.</li>\n<li>Configuration Management: We will update our system to use separate settings for different services, ensuring that changes to one service do not inadvertently impact another.</li>\n<li>Monitoring and Alerts: We will improve our monitoring and alerting systems to detect and respond to issues more quickly.</li>\n</ol>\n<h4 id=\"h_01J2CDA4B7BNCA6EZZPHNVQ2D2\"><strong><br>FOR MORE INFORMATION</strong></h4>\n<p class=\"p1\">For current system status information about your Zendesk, check out our <a href=\"https://status.zendesk.com\">system status page</a>.

Common explanations include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your provider settings: Some providers replace the original caller number with the forwarding number or another default number.</li>\n<li>Possible provider limitations with the caller ID passthrough: When forwarding calls, not all telephony providers support passing through the original caller ID. This is often due to network limitations or policies aimed at preventing spoofing.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To find a solution, reach out to the provider of your forwarding phone number.

This caused our systems to slow down and led to delays in message processing.</p>\n<div id=\"message-list\">\n<h4 id=\"h_01J2DSCCTJ8MC69RN8DC0R6JXP\" class=\"p1\"><strong>Timeline</strong></h4>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>July 02, 2024 10:12 PM UTC | July 02, 2024 03:12 PM PT </strong><br>The issue impacting Answer Bot performance on Pod 13 is now fully resolved.

We will provide another update when we have new information to share.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>July 02, 2024 07:47 PM UTC | July 02, 2024 12:47 PM PT </strong><br>We are investigating reports of Answer Bot degradation on Pod 13.

This caused our systems to slow down, resulting in delays and temporary service interruptions. We took immediate action to manage the increased load and restore normal operations.</p>\n<h4 id=\"h_01J2DSD18VCCNM90XD0WZMBGCB\"><strong>Root Cause Analysis</strong></h4>\n<p>The main cause was a sudden traffic spike, which doubled our usual traffic and saturated our database, leading to delays. Additionally, our AnswerBot service couldn't handle the increased load, causing further disruptions.</p>\n<h4 id=\"h_01J2DSD51H30SSZ9GE3XN6QSRR\"><strong>Resolution</strong></h4>\n<p>To mitigate the issue, we scaled up our database and AnswerBot service, increasing their capacity to handle the surge. This allowed us to restore normal operations and process the backlog of messages.</p>\n<h4 id=\"h_01J2DSD8K47SZQWP2BHMBZJ30S\"><strong>Remediation Items</strong></h4>\n<p>1. Enable Auto-Scaling: Implement automatic scaling for critical services to handle sudden traffic spikes.<br>2. Introduce Circuit Breakers: Prevent overloading of services by temporarily reducing traffic when necessary.<br>3. Improve Monitoring: Enhance our monitoring systems to detect and respond to similar issues more quickly.<br><br></p>\n<h4 id=\"h_01J1W1JCEC1J8X6J4KGSB0C8SR\"><strong>FOR MORE INFORMATION</strong></h4>\n<p class=\"p1\">For current system status information about your Zendesk, check out our <a href=\"https://status.zendesk.com\">system status page</a>.

Why are some recipients missing?</p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01HYBAYSYEBM197897FQ8P2KW9\">Answer</h2>\n<p>Dashboard delivery is divided into virtual groups when being sent out. These virtual groups are created based on matching locale and timezone settings. If both values do not match, a new virtual group is formed. As a result, if no other recipients share the same settings, you will see the email addressed only to you.</p>\n<p>For example, if a scheduled dashboard is configured to send to the following recipients:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Recipient 1\n<ul>\n<li><span>Email: address1@test.com</span></li>\n<li><span>Language: English US</span></li>\n<li><span>Time zone: GMT+02 Madrid</span></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<span>Recipient 2</span>\n<ul>\n<li><span>Email: address2@test.com</span></li>\n<li><span>Language: Spanish</span></li>\n<li><span>Time zone: GMT+02 Madrid</span></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<span>Recipient 3</span>\n<ul>\n<li><span>Email: address3@test.com</span></li>\n<li><span>Language: Spanish</span></li>\n<li><span>Time zone: GMT+1 London</span></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<span>Recipient 4</span>\n<ul>\n<li><span>Email: address4@test.com</span></li>\n<li><span>Language: English US</span></li>\n<li><span>Time zone: GMT+0 UTC</span></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In the scenario above, the recipients do not have matching locale and timezone settings, so each recipient will see themselves as the only address this scheduled dashboard is being delivered to. Conversely, if multiple recipients have matching locale and time zone settings, the list of recipients will be visible in the<code>TO:</code> field of the email:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/7513071453978\"></p>\n<p>For more information, see this article: <a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408843602714-Scheduling-dashboard-deliveries\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Scheduling dashboard deliveries</a>.</p>",
