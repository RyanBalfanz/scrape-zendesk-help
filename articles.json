I need to know whether Copilot features count against my automated resolution allocation, whether I must buy extra resolutions, and whether I need a different add-on for advanced AI.</p><h2 id=\"h_01KG2EM6DJCYFZX9F8JZ5ECJ6Q\">Answer</h2><p>No. The Copilot add-on doesn't include unlimited suggested first replies or unlimited automated resolutions. Your automated resolution allocation governs your use of Copilot features, such as suggested first replies. If you need more automated resolutions, you can buy more. You may incur overage charges if you exceed your allocation.</p><p>The default automated resolution allocation varies by plan. For plan allowances and purchase options, see <a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/5352026794010-About-automated-resolutions-for-AI-agents#topic_hn3_q3x_4wb\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">About automated resolutions for AI agents</a>.</p><p>If you need more advanced AI agent capabilities than Copilot, buy the AI agents - Advanced add-on. It builds on AI agents - Essential and adds conversation flows that combine generative and scripted responses, API access, and advanced analytics.

Due to this disruption, attachments sent during the incident were not delivered and must be resent by end-users.</p><h3 id=\"h_01KFZG5V29VG1SD4TAXW7WBQY8\"><span style=\"color: #06363c;\"><strong>Timeline</strong></span></h3><p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-justify\"><strong>January 20, 2026 05:10 PM UTC | January 20, 2026 09:10 AM PT</strong></p><p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-justify\">We regret to inform you that attachments which were missed during the impact of this incident are unable to be recovered. At this time WhatsApp functionality is back to normal following our fix. Please ask customers to resend attachments if needed.

Due to this problem, the system was unable to retrieve certain media files. The cause was external and unrelated to any changes on our side. Additionally, an internal feature designed to avoid duplicate messages unintentionally prevented the recovery of some missed attachments.</p><h3 id=\"h_01KFZG4TEK3S0H624XCEE8ZJYX\"><span style=\"color: #06363c;\"><strong>Resolution</strong></span></h3><p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-justify\">To fix this issue, we implemented a fix that used an alternative method to retrieve media files, bypassing the affected service. This restored the delivery of new attachments. Unfortunately, attempts to recover attachments that failed during the incident were unsuccessful. Customers have been informed that any missed attachments will need to be resent.</p><h3 id=\"h_01KFZG4TEMNG7MPDTQNV8HRSBY\"><span style=\"color: #06363c;\"><strong>Remediation Items</strong></span></h3><ol>\n<li data-list-item-id=\"eb5f297b8d78e2365f61c4ca710eebd4d\"><p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-justify\">Set up monitoring to specifically track the delivery of media files to quickly identify any future issues.</p></li>\n<li data-list-item-id=\"e139ad06604be0f47a4e1fb58fd4469c6\"><p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-justify\">Review and improve the system that prevents duplicate messages to avoid accidentally blocking valid message retries.</p></li>\n<li data-list-item-id=\"e757ff758adabf7e3ed0a209d2eaedd8e\"><p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-justify\">Consider adding clear notifications for agents when media files cannot be retrieved, to help with awareness and troubleshooting.</p></li>\n</ol>",

When this setting is on, all users (agents and customers) must sign in to view any attachments.

How can I do that?</p><h2 id=\"h_01HYBAYSYEBM197897FQ8P2KW9\">Answer</h2><p>When SSO is enabled, your identity provider handles authentication, so verifying extra email addresses is restricted and must be done while SSO is temporarily turned off. If you need to add and verify additional addresses, temporarily disable SSO, add the additional email addresses, complete the verification, then re-enable SSO.</p><p>We strongly recommend coordinating this operation with your IT or Identity provider team to minimize user impact. For more information on managing SSO in your account, see <a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408882188570-Managing-single-sign-on-SSO-configurations\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Managing single sign-on (SSO) configurations</a>.</p>",

This feature was designed primarily to allow for human readability. Tickets that either have thousands of comment updates or include many side conversations can cause server timeouts. There is no specific number for either of these limitations but a timeout will result when you have reached the upper limits of what our servers can compile for printing. </p><h2 id=\"h_01K7Q9WSQKYW12525JHHAFZ39H\">Why is Zendesk making this change?</h2><p>Customers requested enhancements to this feature, and we are happy to provide them. </p><p>In addition to adding these features, we’ve found that tickets with an excessive amount of comments or included side conversations can result in timeouts while collating the data. This often leads to  a failed process and occupies excessive computational resources. This usually occurs with tickets that have more than a couple thousand comments, a high character count in the comments, or multiple side conversations.</p><h2 id=\"h_01K7Q9WSQKN2G0V0YEMKMSWHBW\">What do I need to do?</h2><p>This feature is available on all eligible accounts. When you choose to print the options to include or exclude certain data appears.

There is no numerical limit to printing a ticket, as a timeout can depend on the lengths of the various comments, but a timeout is the likeliest result of the overall length of the text and number of comments included in the ticket and the time it takes to access them. </p><p><span style=\"color: #1d1c1d;\">If you have feedback or questions related to this announcement, visit our </span><a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/community/topics/1260801325369-Feedback-Ticketing-System-Support-\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\">community forum</span></a><span style=\"color: #1d1c1d;\"> where we collect and manage customer product feedback.

Payline enables secure, agent-assisted credit card payments without exposing agents to sensitive data. Agents maintain voice communication with customers while credit card information is captured separately via phone keypad or via voice, keeping agents completely isolated from payment data. The customer enters their card details using their phone keypad or provides them verbally while the agent guides them through the process. Card data is securely captured, encrypted, and transmitted directly to your payment provider—agents never see, hear, or access sensitive information.</div></li></ul>\n</li>\n<li data-list-item-id=\"e4ef4f37691742a5802917c284e13b7c5\">\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://www.zendesk.com/marketplace/apps/support/1196437/resolver-ai/\"> Resolver AI</a> <strong>(Support) (paid)</strong>\n</div>\n<ul><li data-list-item-id=\"ee30656cc023c01b214df42d72cd5b977\"><div>Resolver AI is a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) Zendesk app that helps agents draft accurate, policy-aligned customer responses in seconds—directly inside the ticket. Instead of “guessing,” Resolver AI retrieves the most relevant Zendesk Help Center articles and synced internal documents and uses them (along with the latest customer query and optional agent instructions) to generate a grounded, high-quality draft response. Ideal for reducing handle time, improving consistency, and ensuring every response stays aligned with approved support content.</div></li></ul>\n</li>\n<li data-list-item-id=\"e02fa29f890e86792039ec0bb00ab72f1\">\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://www.zendesk.com/marketplace/apps/support/1199531/automox-itsm/\">Automox ITSM </a><strong>(Support)</strong>\n</div>\n<ul><li data-list-item-id=\"e7c66a59f80524e4d4bc467f12ff2df1d\"><div>Automox ITSM brings the power of Automox endpoint management directly into your Zendesk workflow.
