However, we know that plenty of use cases for a sandbox require the use of a support email address. </p>\n<p>Support addresses are now replicated, in the following ways, when a sandbox is created:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Internal support addresses (for example, <em>help@yourbusiness.zendesk.com</em>) are automatically replicated.</li>\n<li>External support addresses (for example, <em>help@yourbusiness.com</em>) are replicated but converted as internal addresses of the following format: <em>help-at-yourbusiness-com@sandboxsubdomain.zendesk.com</em>. By converting them to internal addresses, you can test without any additional configuration while still ensuring emails remain in the sandbox environment.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Additionally, if you've set an external support address as the default support address, your sandbox reverts to using the original internal support address: <em>support@yourbusinesssandbox.zendesk.com</em>.</p>\n<p>All references to support addresses in business rules are updated during sandbox creation to reflect these changes so they continue to work without any intervention from you.</p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01GD3S9GD63FPDGQSEFY88M3ND\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Why is Zendesk making this change?</span></h2>\n<p>Zendesk is committed to improving features based on customer feedback. Replicating your support addresses will make it easier for you to create and use premium sandboxes.</p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01GD3S9TSPXM7M4WHYKYF4E84M\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What do I need to do?</span></h2>\n<p>No action is required. This change is available to all accounts with premium sandboxes.

Webhooks are easier to set up and maintain, reducing the complexity involved in managing integrations.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Broader integration options</strong>. With webhooks, you can seamlessly integrate with a wider variety of external services, tools, and platforms without being limited to AWS.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Future-proof</strong>. Zendesk is continuing to develop and enhance our webhook capabilities. Using webhooks ensures you can take advantage of the latest features and enhancements.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Unified approach</strong>. Replacing individual integrations with webhooks simplifies your architecture for event-driven actions, making it easier for you to manage and scale.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Because webhooks provided so many benefits over the Zendesk Events Connector experience and can be used broadly, it doesn't make sense to continue to invest in the Zendesk Events Connector for Amazon EventBridge.</p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01J4J1957XSZZY7H5RYM123X3Z\">Am I affected?</h2>\n<p>Everyone using the Zendesk Events Connector for Amazon EventBridge is affected.</p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01GD3S9TSPXM7M4WHYKYF4E84M\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What do I need to do?</span></h2>\n<p>Transition your event connections to webhooks before December 1, 2025 to prevent any interruptions to your workflows. If you wish to continue to send Zendesk events to Amazon EventBridge, you can configure a Lambda function in front of your EventBridge service so you can accept and process Zendesk webhook events.</p>\n<p>Transitioning each event connection might take some time, so we recommend beginning this process as soon as possible. Currently, webhooks support the following <a href=\"https://developer.zendesk.com/api-reference/webhooks/event-types/webhook-event-types/?_gl=1*x6fzu0*_ga*MjEwOTA5MTUwMC4xNzE2OTk2MzAy*_ga_0G6FC9CS2V*MTcyMzE0ODY5Ny4xNDguMS4xNzIzMTQ4NzAyLjU1LjAuMA..&amp;_ga=2.222583827.909348040.1722863837-2109091500.1716996302\">event types</a>: user, organization, article, community, agent availability, and omnichannel routing configuration events. Additionally, Zendesk plans to add support for messaging and ticket events in the future.</p>\n<p>The following articles describe how to create webhooks and connect them to Amazon EventBridge:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/7778413975322\">Using webhooks to integrate with Amazon EventBridge</a> </li>\n<li><a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408839108378\">Creating webhooks to interact with third-party systems</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"h_01J4J1BE0ATYMPJRVNWEM3421J\">Frequently asked questions</h2>\n<h3 id=\"h_01J4J19FYSDEYN3VYXXXSMVTC1\">What happens if I don't migrate before the removal date?</h3>\n<p>Zendesk will stop sending events to Amazon EventBridge through the Zendesk Events Connector on the deprecation date. If you don't take any action to migrate your event connections over to webhooks prior to that, your workflows depending on the Zendesk Events Connector will break.</p>\n<h3 id=\"h_01J4STP799VE9VQS8FBC17HPRQ\">What are the differences between the payloads for the Zendesk Events Connector and webhooks?</h3>\n<p>While the webhooks will provide all the same information as the Zendesk Events Connector , the structure of the payload is different. Webhooks provide a standardized payload across all events, which makes integrating and working with them much easier and more efficient.</p>\n<p>One thing to note is that when we add support for ticket events to webhooks, the <em>position</em> and <em>total</em> values for the <em>sequence</em> object won't be included. Instead, Zendesk plans to provide a ticket entity stream that will be able to re-materialize an entire standard ticket (excluding custom fields).</p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01J4J1C05JJ99GRT5B01P6AG83\">Who should I contact if I need help or have questions?</h2>\n<p>We encourage you to use the <a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/7778413975322\">migration guide</a> and <a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408839108378\">general webhooks documentation</a> as your primary resources for the transition.</p>\n<p>If you have feedback or questions related to this announcement, visit our <a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/community/topics\">community forum</a> where we collect and manage customer product feedback.

Our experts delivered in-depth demos and addressed key queries during an interactive live Q&amp;A session.</p>\n<p>If you missed the live event, the full recording, a detailed Q&amp;A summary, and additional resources are available in this article.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01J2J1JBEGN4H4873183H69Z3S\"><strong>Event Recording</strong></h2>\n<p><strong><iframe src=\"//www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/w3DIRrnWurU\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01J2J2PYMG0K4GVHW24T575C64\"><strong>Q&amp;A Summary </strong></h2>\n<h4 id=\"h_01J2J3FBJ0WMM0ENT9KSCWQ9SQ\"><strong>Q1. What are some of the best ways to build out this functionality if you don't have a bot yet?</strong></h4>\n<p>The Dataset exporter is indeed the feature that is designed for this use case. At first, it will allow to <a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/6037992005914-Exporting-datasets-from-Explore-Beta\">export raw data as CSV files.</a> For anyone curious you can join the Beta now <a href=\"%C2%A0https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1wesv3ykZXv7GOsif_ZZUF6vEFLqdfB6y0uxeJyDhs5U\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">via this signup form</a>! </p>\n<p> </p>\n<h4 id=\"01J40273S2P8SKY59SSPF085NB\"><strong>Q2. Is there a way to undo a redaction in case something was redacted in error?</strong></h4>\n<p>No, at this time, there is no way to undo a redaction. However, your feedback is valuable, and we will consider it for future updates.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h4 id=\"01J402C40DSD73JRCMS5EAG00Y\"><strong>Q3. Where does HIPAA come into play with Zendesk’s Trusted and Flexible Platform?</strong></h4>\n<p>Zendesk Support and Suite plans at the Professional level and higher include a signed HIPAA BAA. <a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408828395802-Security-Configuration-Requirements-for-HIPAA-or-HDS-Enabled-Accounts-on-Zendesk\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Our documentation lays out the best way</a> to maintain HIPAA compliance using Zendesk. Not all products are covered.<br><br></p>\n<h4 id=\"01J402GTK37CS7N39KEB91J2M1\"><strong>Q4. Are there plans to have scoped API tokens that only give access to a specific set of features?</strong></h4>\n<p>We've had some preliminary discussions about this and there is a long term roadmap that plans to address these issues, but we have not yet settled on a solution.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h4 id=\"01J402JPME0P9Y968JTB1XV68M\"><strong>Q5. Are there plans to have an onboarding page for Marketplace apps that clearly show (and limit) what data they can access?</strong></h4>\n<p>While it's not currently on our roadmap, we will share your suggestion with our Marketplace Product Team for potential inclusion in future updates.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h4 id=\"01J402MNEAGBFNDYK2T5T6XSTD\"><strong>Q6. One instance, two brands, two SSO solutions: are there plans to limit SSO to a specific brand?</strong></h4>\n<p>This is planned. We will be investigating it in the coming year, though we can't yet confirm a timeline just yet.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h4 id=\"01J402PC861GZBJ32HWMMFDDZG\"><strong>Q7. Can we bulk delete tickets based off request type or tag? Would love this feature!</strong></h4>\n<p>Our advanced data privacy and protection package offers a feature called advanced data retention policies which gives you this exact capability!</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h4 id=\"01J402RM2W2MCADVA9DC49EXHJ\"><strong>Q8. Can you redact on a closed ticket?</strong></h4>\n<p>Not yet, but certainly on our roadmap. We're incrementally offering actions that you could perform on closed tickets. Redaction is one of the actions on our radar for the upcoming quarters.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h4 id=\"01J402TD8EQZCS90XEABBMKTH5\"><strong>Q10. Simplified access logs will be accessible for all or only Enterprise?</strong></h4>\n<p>Access logs will be available as part of the Advanced Data Privacy and Protection add-on, which itself is available to <a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/6119316155930-Buying-the-Advanced-Data-Privacy-and-Protection-add-on\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Enterprise plans only</a>. <br><br></p>\n<h4 id=\"01J402WDBRETWXREP6QDQTY3NY\"><strong>Q11. Are private groups only avail on certain plans?</strong></h4>\n<p>Yes, it's available only in <a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/7156636128794-About-private-ticket-groups\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Enterprise plans for both Suite and legacy Support</a>.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h4 id=\"01J402YQ2S41RSEWCJE44RYA6G\"><strong>Q12. Love the new views count on a dashboard. Is there any plan for a drill-in on this count? We'd love to see who is using the dashboards.</strong></h4>\n<p>It is a good idea but it is not on the roadmap for now. Thank you for sharing it. It is a technically complex feature to implement.<br><br></p>\n<h4 id=\"01J403CDKPH40ANZ3A4PK3TF5P\"><strong>Q13. Can we clone classic dashboards during this transition period?</strong></h4>\n<p>It won't be possible to clone classic dashboards during the transitionary period but it will still be possible to edit existing dashboards built with the classic builder.<br><br></p>\n<h4 id=\"01J403EAM9TBC38FNK364BC9H5\"><strong>Q14. Will there be a feature to include cascading filters. For example, we have a category Fields which are broken down into subcategories. If the user selects a ‘category’ in the filter the sub-category should only show those values that are a subset of the parent category?</strong></h4>\n<p>We are actually discussing the cascading functionality, but there is no decision yet made on what filter types it will cover and when we will work on it.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h4 id=\"01J403RZHSQKJS0BJZPMH850W8\"><strong>Q15. Are Custom Objects reportable?</strong></h4>\n<p>Custom objects are not yet reportable, but this is a frequently requested feature and on our roadmap.<br><br></p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01J404JF1G1FPBGVQQB4SE161D\"><strong>Event Resources</strong></h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1qaDHAeXsDepsmsFIbNubs5NMeGu8jO2VDZodzTwV27I/edit?usp=sharing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Event Presentation</a><br><a href=\"https://usergroups.zendesk.com/administrator-user-group/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Admin User Group </a><br><a href=\"https://youtu.be/w3DIRrnWurU\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Event Recording</a></p>",
