We shared our direction for the year on what's coming, and on what we’re working on but will take us a little longer to deliver. </p>\n<p>Your feedback and the questions you all raised are precious to us. Thank you so much for engaging with us in the chat and for coming off mute to ask us questions in person—we loved it!</p>\n<p>We learned a lot from you all about the ways you want us to keep enhancing the reading experience in ticket UI to quickly gather the ticket context and help agents read faster and inturn be more productive when resolving tickets. Here are a few of our top takeaways from the session:</p>\n<p><strong>On our new UI approaches</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Colors to distinguish between agent and end user messages seem like the right direction.</li>\n<li>Keyboard controls to skip through messages is helpful to navigate.</li>\n<li>Channel icons help gather the channel information quickly.<br><br>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>You want more ways to customize the look and feel of conversation log, like</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ability to decide how messages should be aligned, agent on the right, end user on the left or all on the left.</li>\n<li>Ability to change the font size and message background colors.<br><br>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Feedback on the proposed \"Pinned Note\" feature</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You loved the idea of pinning an important note.</li>\n<li>Majority of you expected to be able to pin an existing internal note instead of creating a new one.</li>\n<li>You expect the note to live in the conversation history in the event it is unpinned. Auditing is a major requirement for this feature. Every comment needs to be captured and scanned.</li>\n<li>You also expect triggers to work well with pinned notes.<br><br>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Feedback on the proposed \"Collapsed Messages\" feature</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It will be a big help for the lengthy or detailed messages.</li>\n<li>You would like Ctrl + F to work for the collapsed details as well.<br><br>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Thank you for providing all the valuable insights as we work towards making the current reading experience more efficient. We will continue to provide updates as we work towards releasing some of these features.

      "body": "<h2 id=\"h_01HWZDZCRCG7KXWBYVR75458H1\">Question</h2>\n<p>I am using an automation with the <strong>Hours since</strong> | <strong>is</strong> condition. Why did it stop firing for some of the tickets?<br><img src=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/7216335019418\" alt=\"hours since.png\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01HX725H5CHEC1BNWDF317AM6C\">Answer</h2>\n<p>This problem arises because the <strong>Hours since | Is</strong> condition is very restrictive. Automations run every hour but not necessarily top-of-the-hour or at the same time each hour. For example, you can have a condition in which tickets were assigned 5 hours ago. If you assign the ticket at 10:03, and the automation fires at 15:01, then the ticket was only assigned 4 hours and 58 minutes ago and the automation isn't yet true. If the next time the automation fires is 16:06, then the ticket was assigned 6 hours and 3 minutes ago, and the condition fails again.</p>\n<p>To avoid this issue, we recommend using <strong>Hours since | Greater than</strong> because it offers a bigger time window in which the condition is valid.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/7268512100122\" alt=\"Greater than.png\"></p>\n<p>However, you must also define a <a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408832701850-About-automations-and-how-they-work#topic_mbl_q4f_tm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">nullifying condition or action</a> to ensure <strong>Greater than</strong> conditions are true only once for a ticket.</p>\n<p>For more information, see these articles:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408836495130-Using-the-Hours-since-condition-in-automations#topic_ld3_5d1_tqb\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Using \"Hours since...is\" conditions</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408832701850-About-automations-and-how-they-work#:~:text=last%2014%20days.-,Understanding%20when%20automation%20actions%20fire,-Automations%20run%20in\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Understanding when automation actions fire</a></li>\n</ul>"

For the most recent offerings, see <a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408846483482\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Zendesk Talk number availability and pricing</a> and use the provided dropdown menu.</li>\n<li>Ensure that agents are <a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408823796890\">taking calls through the browser</a> rather than using phones to avoid additional costs.</li>\n<li>Promote the <a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408884087706-Enabling-customer-callback\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">callback option</a> to customers. Callback requests don't incur costs while customers are waiting, unlike costs that accumulate when callers remain on hold.</li>\n<li>Implement <a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408830696090-Understanding-Talk-Embedded-voice\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">digital lines</a>, such as a call button on your website or mobile app, enabling customers to contact support over the internet rather than through traditional phone lines.</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408836253338\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Analyze the volume and costs</a> of abandoned calls each month and devise strategies to decrease these occurrences.</li>\n<li>Regularly access and export data from your <a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408825620378-Reviewing-your-Talk-usage-charges\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">usage charges</a> for a detailed breakdown of your charges. Input the dates from your Talk invoice and obtain specific usage information. Export the report to CSV for an in-depth analysis. You will be able to identify the most expensive calls and evaluate whether your current setup is cost-effective.</li>\n<li>Redirect calls to self-service options like a knowledge base, <a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4598810401562-How-can-I-send-an-automatic-text-when-customers-call-in\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">SMS or messaging</a> and other self-service channels. Reserve voice calls to handle complex customer issues.</li>\n<li>If you already are a Zendesk customer, use the <a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408846483482-Zendesk-Talk-number-availability-and-pricing#h_b03191e2-5c41-40f5-81bb-9752cb9de841\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">package discounts on Talk credit</a>.
