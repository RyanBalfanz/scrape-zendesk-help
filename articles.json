Our expert panel delved into key topics such as customization, analytics, and security, showcasing pivotal tools like Custom Objects, Dashboard Builder, and Redaction Suggestions.</p>\n<p>The event provided valuable insights into elevating customer support, leveraging advanced analytics, and ensuring data security. Our experts delivered in-depth demos and addressed key queries during an interactive live Q&amp;A session.</p>\n<p>If you missed the live event, the full recording, a detailed Q&amp;A summary, and additional resources are available in this article.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01J2J1JBEGN4H4873183H69Z3S\"><strong>Event Recording</strong></h2>\n<p><strong><iframe src=\"//www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/w3DIRrnWurU\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01J2J2PYMG0K4GVHW24T575C64\"><strong>Q&amp;A Summary </strong></h2>\n<h4 id=\"h_01J2J3FBJ0WMM0ENT9KSCWQ9SQ\"><strong>Q1. What are some of the best ways to build out this functionality if you don't have a bot yet?</strong></h4>\n<p>The Dataset exporter is indeed the feature that is designed for this use case. At first, it will allow to <a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/6037992005914-Exporting-datasets-from-Explore-Beta\">export raw data as CSV files.</a> For anyone curious you can join the Beta now <a href=\"%C2%A0https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1wesv3ykZXv7GOsif_ZZUF6vEFLqdfB6y0uxeJyDhs5U\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">via this signup form</a>! </p>\n<p> </p>\n<h4 id=\"01J40273S2P8SKY59SSPF085NB\"><strong>Q2. Is there a way to undo a redaction in case something was redacted in error?</strong></h4>\n<p>No, at this time, there is no way to undo a redaction. However, your feedback is valuable, and we will consider it for future updates.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h4 id=\"01J402C40DSD73JRCMS5EAG00Y\"><strong>Q3. Where does HIPAA come into play with Zendesk’s Trusted and Flexible Platform?</strong></h4>\n<p>Zendesk Support and Suite plans at the Professional level and higher include a signed HIPAA BAA. <a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408828395802-Security-Configuration-Requirements-for-HIPAA-or-HDS-Enabled-Accounts-on-Zendesk\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Our documentation lays out the best way</a> to maintain HIPAA compliance using Zendesk. Not all products are covered.<br><br></p>\n<h4 id=\"01J402GTK37CS7N39KEB91J2M1\"><strong>Q4. Are there plans to have scoped API tokens that only give access to a specific set of features?</strong></h4>\n<p>We've had some preliminary discussions about this and there is a long term roadmap that plans to address these issues, but we have not yet settled on a solution.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h4 id=\"01J402JPME0P9Y968JTB1XV68M\"><strong>Q5. Are there plans to have an onboarding page for Marketplace apps that clearly show (and limit) what data they can access?</strong></h4>\n<p>While it's not currently on our roadmap, we will share your suggestion with our Marketplace Product Team for potential inclusion in future updates.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h4 id=\"01J402MNEAGBFNDYK2T5T6XSTD\"><strong>Q6. One instance, two brands, two SSO solutions: are there plans to limit SSO to a specific brand?</strong></h4>\n<p>This is planned. We will be investigating it in the coming year, though we can't yet confirm a timeline just yet.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h4 id=\"01J402PC861GZBJ32HWMMFDDZG\"><strong>Q7. Can we bulk delete tickets based off request type or tag? Would love this feature!</strong></h4>\n<p>Our advanced data privacy and protection package offers a feature called advanced data retention policies which gives you this exact capability!</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h4 id=\"01J402RM2W2MCADVA9DC49EXHJ\"><strong>Q8. Can you redact on a closed ticket?</strong></h4>\n<p>Not yet, but certainly on our roadmap. We're incrementally offering actions that you could perform on closed tickets. Redaction is one of the actions on our radar for the upcoming quarters.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h4 id=\"01J402TD8EQZCS90XEABBMKTH5\"><strong>Q10. Simplified access logs will be accessible for all or only Enterprise?</strong></h4>\n<p>Access logs will be available as part of the Advanced Data Privacy and Protection add-on, which itself is available to <a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/6119316155930-Buying-the-Advanced-Data-Privacy-and-Protection-add-on\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Enterprise plans only</a>. <br><br></p>\n<h4 id=\"01J402WDBRETWXREP6QDQTY3NY\"><strong>Q11. Are private groups only avail on certain plans?</strong></h4>\n<p>Yes, it's available only in <a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/7156636128794-About-private-ticket-groups\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Enterprise plans for both Suite and legacy Support</a>.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h4 id=\"01J402YQ2S41RSEWCJE44RYA6G\"><strong>Q12. Love the new views count on a dashboard. Is there any plan for a drill-in on this count? We'd love to see who is using the dashboards.</strong></h4>\n<p>It is a good idea but it is not on the roadmap for now. Thank you for sharing it. It is a technically complex feature to implement.<br><br></p>\n<h4 id=\"01J403CDKPH40ANZ3A4PK3TF5P\"><strong>Q13. Can we clone classic dashboards during this transition period?</strong></h4>\n<p>It won't be possible to clone classic dashboards during the transitionary period but it will still be possible to edit existing dashboards built with the classic builder.<br><br></p>\n<h4 id=\"01J403EAM9TBC38FNK364BC9H5\"><strong>Q14. Will there be a feature to include cascading filters. For example, we have a category Fields which are broken down into subcategories. If the user selects a ‘category’ in the filter the sub-category should only show those values that are a subset of the parent category?</strong></h4>\n<p>We are actually discussing the cascading functionality, but there is no decision yet made on what filter types it will cover and when we will work on it.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h4 id=\"01J403RZHSQKJS0BJZPMH850W8\"><strong>Q15. Are Custom Objects reportable?</strong></h4>\n<p>Custom objects are not yet reportable, but this is a frequently requested feature and on our roadmap.<br><br></p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01J404JF1G1FPBGVQQB4SE161D\"><strong>Event Resources</strong></h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1qaDHAeXsDepsmsFIbNubs5NMeGu8jO2VDZodzTwV27I/edit?usp=sharing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Event Presentation</a><br><a href=\"https://usergroups.zendesk.com/administrator-user-group/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Admin User Group </a><br><a href=\"https://youtu.be/w3DIRrnWurU\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Event Recording</a></p>",

Through initial use and user feedback, we identified several areas for improvement using ChatGPT-4o. This upgrade leverages advanced prompt engineering and the enhanced capabilities of ChatGPT-4o to address the following issues:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Improved response accuracy.</li>\n<li>Reduction of language errors in expansions and tone changes, as well as accuracy issues with ticket summarization.</li>\n<li>Mitigation of errors related to max ticket length when summary is used, due to ChatGPT-4o's larger context window.</li>\n<li>Enhanced feature performance, ensuring efficient agent operations.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"01J3YYKEJK6HW5ZGQBVXZHZ6Y1\">Why is Zendesk making this change?</h2>\n<p>These features are widely used across various industries, with over 1.5 million monthly uses. We anticipate that these enhancements, which are based on user feedback, will further boost efficiency, reducing the time to first response and resolution, thereby increasing customer satisfaction.</p>\n<p>We understand that new ChatGPT models generally offer better accuracy, improved performance, and fewer hallucinations. To stay ahead, we have invested and will continue to invest in improving our testing and regression processes, enabling us to more swiftly adopt future ChatGPT versions while maintaining high quality standards.</p>\n<h2 id=\"01J3YYKZG81WNYKCW13JJD5722\">What do I need to do?</h2>\n<p>If you have the <a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/5524125586330\">Advanced AI add-on</a> and you've already <a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/6948495103002\">turned on the generative AI setting</a> in the Admin Center, then no further action is necessary.

How is this possible?</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://zen-marketing-documentation.s3.amazonaws.com/docs/en/explore_state_detail_duration_example.png\" width=\"600\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01HYBAYSYEBM197897FQ8P2KW9\">Answer</h2>\n<p>You might see a state duration of longer than 24 hours for a single day when you apply a multi-day <strong>Time</strong> filter on the <strong>State Detail</strong> tab. The time filter applies to both the <strong>Start time</strong> and the <strong>End time</strong> of an agent state, which affects the data is included in the report.</p>\n<p>To return the correct duration in the report, your report has to have the <strong>Start time</strong> and an <strong>End time</strong> associated with the change of state. If it doesn’t have both times, it can’t calculate the duration.</p>\n<p>For example: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>If you apply a <strong>Time</strong> filter that excludes one of the times, the report will not return the duration.</li>\n<li>If you apply a <strong>Time</strong> filter that includes both times, the duration is returned and is reported on the date the start time occurred, even if the end time occurred on a different date. As a result, a multi-day state duration is reported on what looks like a single day.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"h_01J3JMG11TTP2NG97XEG5DRE14\">A typical example</h3>\n<p>Consider the following example, also shown in the screenshot above:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>On May 14 at 10:09 PM, an agent goes offline and leaves for vacation.</li>\n<li>On May 24 at 2:50 PM, the agent returns from vacation and comes back online.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>At the end of May, the agent supervisor opens the <strong>State Detail</strong> dashboard tab and applies a time filter for May 1 through May 31 to see data for the entire month. The supervisor then sees that on May 14, the agent has an offline duration of 232 hours. </p>\n<p>This value is being returned because the agent entered the <strong>Offline</strong> status on May 14, and left the <strong>Offline</strong> status on May 24. Because the <strong>Time</strong> filter is set for the entire month of May, and because the <strong>Start time</strong> and <strong>End time</strong> associated with the state change occurred during the month of May, the report is able to calculate the <strong>Duration</strong> for the state. It then reports the state duration as occurring on May 14, the date of the start time.</p>\n<h3 id=\"h_01J3JMGJCY16A9MAXTVA012HJE\">Reporting on a single day</h3>\n<p>Conversely, if the supervisor were to filter the report to only a single day, May 14, the report would not return any information, including <strong>Duration</strong>, for the state change when the agent went offline at 10:09. This is because the end time associated with that state change didn’t occur during the time filter. As a result, the duration wouldn’t be returned because it can’t be calculated given the time filter.</p>\n<p>To see a daily snapshot of the agent time spent in various states, use the <a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/5600290657434#topic_t4m_xhf_2xb\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Agent state daily dataset</a> instead.

About 1% of customer requests returned 503 errors when accessing authenticated features within Guide, Talk, Chat, Explore, and Support, and customers were unable to open Zendesk’s Product Tray to switch between products. Several errors were presented in the Product Tray as well as in the main web browser page.</p>\n<h3 id=\"h_01J3J22GENDHFTN0CCQYZDAV5A\" class=\"undefined\">Timeline</h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>July 23, 2024 11:48 AM UTC | July 23, 2024 04:48 AM PT </strong><br>We’re aware of and working on mitigating issues for customers on Pod 29 who are unable to load the Admin Center and are getting “The page isn’t working” error. Other products also seem to be unavailable from the Product tray with “Can’t load Zendesk products. Try again” error. Next update in 30 minutes, or when we have more to share.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>July 23, 2024 12:19 PM UTC | July 23, 2024 05:19 AM PT </strong><br>We continue to work towards resolving the access issues surrounding multiple products for customers on Pod 29. Your patience is greatly appreciated.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>July 23, 2024 01:22 PM UTC | July 23, 2024 06:22 AM PT </strong><br>We are continuing to work on possible solutions for the access issues affecting multiple products for customers on Pod 29. Thank you for your patience with us during this time.</p>\n<p class=\"undefined\"><strong>July 23, 2024 01:46 PM UTC | July 23, 2024 06:46 AM PT </strong><br>We have implemented a potential fix and we’re noticing a decrease in errors, along with some improvements when loading test accounts on Pod 29. We kindly ask you to clear your cache and cookies, and then try to load Zendesk again. </p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>July 23, 2024 02:06 PM UTC | July 23, 2024 07:06 AM PT </strong><br>Although we’ve been receiving some positive confirmations that things are working, we continue to monitor for possible new spikes in errors. We appreciate your patience while we wait to mark this issue as fully resolved.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>July 23, 2024 03:19 PM UTC | July 23, 2024 08:19 AM PT </strong><br>We have identified the root cause of the issue and have rolled back the change to prevent further problems. After additional monitoring, we have confirmed no further errors and are marking this incident as fully resolved.</p>\n</div>\n<h3 id=\"h_01J43TVXAJ48GR9A74B7MY44YP\"> </h3>\n<h3 id=\"h_01J43TVXAJ4F5GCFYGDEQ3J36Y\"><strong>POST-MORTEM</strong></h3>\n<h3 id=\"h_01J43PMGJ1CW4YVM0VZX9JX408\">Root Cause Analysis</h3>\n<p>This incident was caused by the rollout of the new manage team members permission. This release allows agents in custom roles to be granted permission to view and manage other team members and their role assignments as a standalone permission (<a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/7536595614746\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\" style=\"color: #1155cc;\">announcement</span></a>). This rollout led to a large increase in requests to the underlying internal permissions service, resulting in capacity saturation of its database cluster. As a result of this traffic, the cluster reached its maximum network bandwidth capacity, causing a networking failure between the cluster and our service’s app servers.</p>\n<h3 id=\"h_01J43PMGJ12M1HD39XYX4Q4KG4\">Resolution</h3>\n<p>To fix this issue, our team initially increased the capacity of the permissions service’s database instance to provide short-term recovery. Once the root cause was identified, our engineers rolled back the permissions feature code change.</p>\n<h3 id=\"h_01J43PMGJ19GEPTG1XFDDV7M68\">Remediation Items</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Reduce network traffic from permissions checks [In Progress]</li>\n<li>Additional monitors and alerts to detect traffic increases [Scheduled]</li>\n<li>Investigate right-sizing permissions service database capacity [Scheduled]</li>\n</ol>\n<h4 id=\"h_01J3J1YM9BKWACPAPJN13VPD43\"><strong>For more information</strong></h4>\n<p class=\"p1\">For current system status information about your Zendesk, check out our <a href=\"https://status.zendesk.com\">system status page</a>. The summary of our post-mortem investigation is usually posted here a few days after the incident has ended.

However, there could be times when you\n            want to handle work within a channel differently, such as the status of the\n            conversation. This recipe describes how to prioritize the routing of active messaging\n            conversations and deprioritize inactive messaging conversations.</p>\n<p class=\"p\">This recipe uses omnichannel routing, groups, custom queues, and triggers.</p>\n<div class=\"p\">This example includes:<ul class=\"ul\" id=\"topic_j5h_nwb_ccc__ul_b5r_nl3_1yb\">\n<li class=\"li\"><a class=\"xref\" href=\"#topic_ann_ch3_ccc\">Workflow goals</a></li>\n<li class=\"li\"><a class=\"xref\" href=\"#topic_vq5_1j3_ccc\">Setting up your omnichannel routing configuration</a></li>\n<li class=\"li\"><a class=\"xref\" href=\"#topic_jqy_ch3_ccc\">Creating groups of agents to handle active and inactive messages</a></li>\n<li class=\"li\"><a class=\"xref\" href=\"#topic_m24_gn3_ccc\">Creating triggers to identify when messaging tickets become inactive</a></li>\n<li class=\"li\"><a class=\"xref\" href=\"#topic_ovw_dh3_ccc\">Configuring custom queues for active and inactive messages</a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div aria-labelledby=\"ariaid-title2\" class=\"topic nested1\" id=\"topic_ann_ch3_ccc\">\n<h2 class=\"title topictitle2\" id=\"ariaid-title2\">Workflow goals</h2>\n<div class=\"body\">\n<p class=\"p\">All unassigned messaging conversations become inactive after 10 minutes without end\n                user interaction. The standard omnichannel routing configuration counts only active\n                messaging conversations towards an agent's capacity. This behavior is controlled by\n                the messaging activity routing setting. When messaging activity routing is off,\n                messaging tickets that become inactive while still in a queue can be assigned to any\n                available agent without taking up their capacity. Your organization wants to\n                prioritize the routing of active messaging conversations to agents and leave\n                inactive messaging conversations to be processed less urgently by a separate group\n                of agents.</p>\n<div class=\"p\">Because omnichannel routing prioritizes all tickets routed through custom queues over\n                work that doesn't match a custom queue and ends up in the standard queue, you have\n                two options to accomplish this workflow:<ul class=\"ul\" id=\"topic_ann_ch3_ccc__ul_q2c_qw3_ccc\">\n<li class=\"li\">You can create two custom queues, one to route active messaging\n                        conversations and another to route inactive messaging conversations. This\n                        approach provides the ability to designate multiple primary and secondary\n                        groups of agents for each queue.</li>\n<li class=\"li\">You can create one custom queue to route active messaging conversations and\n                        rely on the standard omnichannel routing queue to route the inactive\n                        messaging conversations. With this approach, you can designate multiple\n                        primary and secondary groups to handle active messaging conversations routed\n                        through the custom queue, but the inactive messaging conversations would\n                        need to have a group assigned to the ticket (typically via trigger) and\n                        would then be assigned only to agents within the ticket's specified\n                        group.</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<p class=\"p\">After discussing with your team, you decide creating two custom queues is the best\n                approach.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div aria-labelledby=\"ariaid-title3\" class=\"topic nested1\" id=\"topic_vq5_1j3_ccc\">\n<h2 class=\"title topictitle2\" id=\"ariaid-title3\">Setting up your omnichannel routing configuration</h2>\n<div class=\"body\">\n<div class=\"p\">There are many omnichannel routing settings you can configure.

However, you might\n                still want to configure the inactivity period and ticket statuses for inactive\n                conversations to help your agents manage their capacity of assigned work.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div aria-labelledby=\"ariaid-title4\" class=\"topic nested1\" id=\"topic_jqy_ch3_ccc\">\n<h2 class=\"title topictitle2\" id=\"ariaid-title4\">Creating groups of agents to handle active and inactive messages</h2>\n<div class=\"body\">\n<p class=\"p\">Groups collect agents together, allowing admins to manage agent ticket assignments\n                based on an agent's skills, experience, or other similarities. To implement this\n                workflow, your organization has decided to split the agents handling messaging\n                conversations into four groups. The first two, Active Primary and Active Secondary,\n                are the agents you want to handle all active messaging conversations.

Instead, you have to understand the changes\n                that occur when a message changes from active to inactive and define triggers to act\n                based on those details. For this workflow, you'll need to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408886797466\" target=\"_blank\">create two triggers</a>. The first adds a tag to all new\n                messaging tickets, which provides a queue condition you can use to identify a\n                messaging conversation as still active when it reaches the front of the queue.\n                Because chat transcripts aren't added to messaging conversations until it\n                transitions to inactive, you can use that update as a trigger condition to update\n                the tags and thus provide a queue condition to identify inactive messaging\n                conversations.</p>\n<div class=\"note note\">\n<span class=\"notetitle\">Note:</span> There isn't a way to use triggers to detect a message moving from an\n                    <em class=\"ph i\">inactive</em> state back to <em class=\"ph i\">active</em>. The closest approximation would be\n                a trigger with conditions indicating an update to a messaging ticket with the\n                    <code class=\"ph codeph\">inactive</code> tag.

This affected users trying to connect to core services like the Agent Activity Tracker, resulting in performance issues.  </p>\n<h4 id=\"h_01J3HT0Z48VAZVEKQ98TJTTXTN\" class=\"p1\"><strong>Timeline</strong></h4>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>July 17, 2024 12:28 PM UTC | July 17, 2024 05:28 AM PT</strong></p>\n<p class=\"undefined\">Unfortunately, we experienced the similar issues again today, resulting in another spike in errors with some of the same symptoms. Clearing your cache or using an incognito window should resolve the issue. We will be monitoring errors for the next 24 hours, and if there are no further occurrences, the new incident will be merged into this one. Thank you for your patience and understanding.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>July 16, 2024 04:32 PM UTC | July 16, 2024 09:32 AM PT </strong><br>We've received multiple customer confirmations that clearing cache and cookies has restored access to Zendesk WFM and will be marking this incident as fully resolved.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>July 16, 2024 02:38 PM UTC | July 16, 2024 07:38 AM PT </strong><br>We have observed that the errors on the backend have subsided. We kindly request that you clear your cache and cookies and then confirm whether things are working as expected.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>July 16, 2024 01:59 PM UTC | July 16, 2024 06:59 AM PT </strong><br>In addition to the general platform errors mentioned previously, some customers are also unable to load the WFM widget correctly within Support and the Chrome extension, across multiple Pods.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>July 16, 2024 01:42 PM UTC | July 16, 2024 06:42 AM PT </strong><br>Upon receiving negative confirmation from customers regarding the resolution of the issues, we continue to investigate the problem with Zendesk WFM (formerly Tymeshift). A subset of customers are still seeing the errors “You don’t have access to this feature” and “Something didn’t work / Give it a moment and try again” when trying to access the organization structure. We will provide more information in 1 hour or as soon as we have additional details to share.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>July 16, 2024 01:06 PM UTC | July 16, 2024 06:06 AM PT </strong><br>We are currently seeing improvements in the backend handling of traffic for the impacted accounts, and these accounts should now be able to start loading Zendesk WFM within Zendesk.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>July 16, 2024 12:39 PM UTC | July 16, 2024 05:39 AM PT </strong><br>We are currently investigating reports of slowness or inability to load Zendesk WFM (formerly known as Tymeshift) for some customers across multiple Pods. We will provide more updates in 30 minutes or as soon as we have more details.</p>\n</div>\n<p class=\"p1\"> </p>\n<h3 id=\"h_01J3HT1Z71MZWWG0P6TMS086JW\" class=\"p1\"><strong>POST-MORTEM</strong></h3>\n<p>Due to a configuration limit, some of our network traffic exceeded the maximum allowed usage during peak times. This wasn't immediately visible, and the resultant delays impacted the customer experience. Once aware, we worked quickly to increase this limit and adjust our configuration to better handle traffic.</p>\n<h4 id=\"h_01J3HT372D5PN4RRS94S4T2F1P\"><strong>Root Cause Analysis</strong></h4>\n<p>The root cause was a default setting that limited the number of communication channels available, which we exceeded as our customer base and traffic grew.</p>\n<h4 id=\"h_01J3HT3K6QTVJWRCT807GN11ME\"><strong>Resolution</strong></h4>\n<p>By increasing the capacity and reconfiguring the appropriate settings, we have resolved the underlying issue. Additional steps were taken to ensure continued stability.</p>\n<h4 id=\"h_01J3HT3T4T7PG341DBSQWG8QE2\"><strong>Remediation</strong></h4>\n<p>To prevent similar issues in the future, we are implementing the following measures:</p>\n<p>1. Capacity Monitoring: We are adding proactive monitoring to alert us when we approach capacity limits.<br>2. Configuration Reviews: We are reviewing and adjusting our configurations across all regions to ensure they are prepared for increased traffic.<br>3. Improved Response Plans: We are strengthening our incident response procedures to quickly diagnose and resolve any future issues.</p>\n<h4 id=\"h_01J3HT372D00ZX6V9VWF0370YK\"> </h4>\n<h4 id=\"h_01J30AWQ6N8EQS8HWVW6EXD5JN\"><strong>FOR MORE INFORMATION</strong></h4>\n<p class=\"p1\">For current system status information about your Zendesk, check out our <a href=\"https://status.zendesk.com\">system status page</a>. The summary of our post-mortem investigation is usually posted here a few days after the incident has ended.
