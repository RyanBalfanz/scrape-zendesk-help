You can also recreate the ticket for the end user with less than 32,000 characters if a long thread was added to a short reply.</li>\n</ol>\n<p class=\"p1\">For more information, refer to this Salesforce article: <a href=\"https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=000383031&amp;type=1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The default limit on Long Text Area fields is 32,768 characters</a>. </p>",

All ticket reassignments by omnichannel routing went through the standard queue.</p>\n<p>Now, admins on Professional plans and above have the option to configure omnichannel routing to reassign tickets through custom queues. Specifically, when you turn on reassignment through queues, tickets that are reassigned back to a group go through custom queues to be assigned to an agent. Otherwise only the standard queue is used to reassign tickets.</p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01GD3S9GD63FPDGQSEFY88M3ND\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Why is Zendesk making this change?</span></h2>\n<p>Zendesk received a lot of feedback that users wanted to be able to use custom queues to re-route work, not just route new work. Because work from custom queues is always prioritized over work in the standard queue, reassigned tickets often had to wait longer than desirable to be reassigned to an agent and could lead to negative customer experiences and SLA breaches. This new setting gives admins the control to decide which workflow works best for their reassigned tickets.</p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01GD3S9TSPXM7M4WHYKYF4E84M\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What do I need to do?</span></h2>\n<p>The new setting is being rolled out to all accounts with omnichannel routing. If you have a Professional plan or above, you can edit your routing configuration to turn on reassignment through queues.

Agents can accept or edit these suggestions. When a reply is accepted, it will be sent to the end user in the name of the agent. If an action is accepted, agent copilot will execute it so that the agent doesn’t have to.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://zen-marketing-documentation.s3.amazonaws.com/docs/en/ai_auto_assist_example_suggestion.png\" width=\"600\"></p>\n<p>This way, agents save time on coming up with next steps or actions and instead just supervise the copilot, freeing up their time to focus on more meaningful and complex tasks. Agent copilot works in any industry and doesn’t require intent predictions.</p>\n<p>We are opening the agent copilot EAP to all Zendesk customers with the Advanced AI add-on whose Zendesk instance has been migrated to the <a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/6041628932250\">omnichannel messaging backend</a>.</p>\n<p>To sign up, <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScjMd9__L7RXEtZvS9IQLQz_3--OOZxam2FsIh2BX72lraFTA/viewform\">submit the EAP form</a> and select agent copilot from the list of available options.</p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01J7GPT6FNTW8D42KA4R6S0GK7\">How will this affect me?</h2>\n<p>If you signed up for the agent copilot EAP and your account meets the requirements mentioned above, you will get access to agent copilot within 5 business days of signing up.</p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01J7GPT98Q8HTVW9B3KEK0CZWS\">What do I need to do?</h2>\n<p>After you sign up for the EAP, there is nothing more to do. If your account meets the requirements it will be enabled within 5 business days of signing up. For more information on using agent copilot, see <a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/7051314237466\">Using agent copilot to help agents solve tickets (EAP)</a>.</p>\n<p>If you have feedback or questions related to this announcement, visit our <a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/community/topics/6447052855194\">community forum</a> where we collect and manage customer product feedback.

Agents are considered available to\n            receive work through omnichannel routing when they have an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/5133523363226\" target=\"_blank\">eligible status</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4776409839770\" target=\"_blank\">spare capacity</a> for the channel. </p>\n<p class=\"p\">When configuring omnichannel routing, you can choose whether to assign work based on the\n            highest spare capacity or based on the time elapsed since agents last received work for\n            that channel, which is commonly referred to as <em class=\"ph i\">round robin</em>.</p>\n<div class=\"p\">This article contains the following topics:<ul class=\"ul\" id=\"topic_flz_q32_rcc__ul_sb1_rj2_rcc\">\n<li class=\"li\"><a class=\"xref\" href=\"#topic_lcv_sj2_rcc\">Understanding how round robin routing changes the standard omnichannel routing behavior</a></li>\n<li class=\"li\"><a class=\"xref\" href=\"#topic_omj_rj2_rcc\">Turning on round robin routing</a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div aria-labelledby=\"ariaid-title2\" class=\"topic nested1\" id=\"topic_lcv_sj2_rcc\">\n<h2 class=\"title topictitle2\" id=\"ariaid-title2\">Understanding how round robin routing changes the standard omnichannel routing behavior</h2>\n<div class=\"body\">\n<p class=\"p\">The assignment methods for omnichannel routing are straightforward on the surface:\n                either you're routing based on spare capacity or time since last assignment for the\n                channel. However, the way these methods interact with other routing configuration\n                options can help you make an informed decision when setting up your own omnichannel\n                routing workflows.</p>\n<div class=\"p\">When using round robin assignment, omnichannel routing bases the round robin\n                assignment on the last time each available agent was assigned work for the channel\n                    (<a class=\"xref\" href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4409149119514#topic_psx_hxk_3yb\" target=\"_blank\">email</a>, messaging, or calls). Therefore,\n                it's important to understand that omnichannel routing considers the following events\n                as assignments:<ul class=\"ul\" id=\"topic_lcv_sj2_rcc__ul_rrr_kwy_rcc\">\n<li class=\"li\">Any ticket assignment to an agent, whether manual or by omnichannel\n                        routing</li>\n<li class=\"li\">A call or messaging ticket is offered to an agent</li>\n<li class=\"li\">A ticket assigned to an agent is reopened</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div class=\"p\">The following examples demonstrate how each assignment method would cause omnichannel\n                routing to offer a messaging conversation ticket in different scenarios:<ul class=\"ul\" id=\"topic_lcv_sj2_rcc__ul_wq3_qk2_rcc\">\n<li class=\"li\"><a class=\"xref\" href=\"#topic_igm_qk2_rcc\">Scenario 1: Agents available</a></li>\n<li class=\"li\"><a class=\"xref\" href=\"#topic_eyw_tk2_rcc\">Scenario 2: No agents have spare capacity</a></li>\n<li class=\"li\"><a class=\"xref\" href=\"#topic_qbs_5k2_rcc\">Scenario 3: Routing with focus mode turned on</a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div aria-labelledby=\"ariaid-title3\" class=\"topic nested2\" id=\"topic_igm_qk2_rcc\">\n<h3 class=\"title topictitle3\" id=\"ariaid-title3\">Scenario 1: Agents available</h3>\n<div class=\"body\">\n<div class=\"p\">In this scenario, there are three agents in the group, all of whom have a status\n                    of Online.<ul class=\"ul\" id=\"topic_igm_qk2_rcc__ul_sll_gl2_rcc\">\n<li class=\"li\">\n<strong class=\"ph b\">Agent 1</strong>: Has a spare capacity of 1.

This is because focus mode prevents omnichannel routing from\n                    assigning messaging tickets to an agent while they're working on a call and vice\n                    versa. Email tickets are excluded from focus mode, and therefore would be routed\n                    to agent 1 in this scenario. </p>\n<p class=\"p\">Additionally, if focus mode wasn't enabled but all other factors remained the\n                    same, omnichannel routing would assign the ticket to agent 1 because they've had\n                    the longest time elapsed since being assigned a ticket for the channel.</p>\n<p class=\"p\"><strong class=\"ph b\">Highest spare capacity</strong></p>\n<p class=\"p\">If you're using the standard method of highest spare capacity with focus mode,\n                    omnichannel routing assigns the messaging ticket to agent 3 because they have\n                    the most spare capacity for the channel while also not having an active call.\n                    This is because focus mode prevents omnichannel routing from assigning messaging\n                    tickets to an agent while they're working on a call and vice versa. </p>\n<p class=\"p\">Email tickets are excluded from focus mode, and therefore would be routed to\n                    agent 1 in this scenario because agent 1 and agent 3 have the same spare\n                    capacity, but agent 1 has gone longer without being assigned work for the\n                    channel.

Consequently, agents were unable to send messages or initiate calls to these end users.</p>\n<h3 id=\"h_01J7B3JGJKBPS06DWMQ0ET2F1N\"><span style=\"color: #06363c;\">Timeline</span></h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>September 04, 2024 01:05 PM UTC | September 04, 2024 06:05 AM PT </strong><br>Between 12:16 PM UTC on August 30th and 09:15 AM UTC on September 2nd, customers using Talk and Support reported an extra “1” being added to end-user phone numbers. This issue impacted their ability to make calls and required manual corrections. Any customer who received SMS messages in the last five days would have been affected. On Monday, we identified the root cause and rectified the issue. Unfortunately, the previously deployed fix was accidentally rolled back yesterday. However, our engineers have re-deployed the fix, and the issue is now fully resolved. The fix ensures that any new user identities created during the active period of the fix do not have the rogue “1\" appended. Additionally, the temporary rollback has been corrected, ensuring that no new user identities are created with the erroneous “1”.</p>\n</div>\n<h3 id=\"h_01J7BQAGZGGT5MA2KWTRBKCBWC\" class=\"undefined\"><strong><br>POST-MORTEM</strong></h3>\n<h3 id=\"h_01J7B3MY286YEPWQJJEXKVEDRV\"><span style=\"color: #06363c;\">Root Cause Analysis</span></h3>\n<p>This incident occurred due to an unintended consequence of a cleanup pull request (PR) that reactivated an old rollout process from 2018. This process automatically updated new SMS end users' phone numbers, adding an \"sms_capability\" attribute with a value of \"1\". The extension model fetched this information, resulting in an erroneous “1” being appended to the phone numbers of new SMS end users. </p>\n<h3 id=\"h_01J7B3MY28YGPCA7K4YDNYH1S8\"><span style=\"color: #06363c;\">Resolution</span></h3>\n<p>To resolve this issue, the problematic code responsible for adding the \"1\" to new SMS end users' phone numbers was identified and disabled. Ensuring that the sms_capability attribute is no longer incorrectly applied to phone numbers.</p>\n<h3 id=\"h_01J7B3MY2850V22JPB988ZF0S3\"><span style=\"color: #06363c;\">Remediation Items</span></h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Fix the User Phone Extension model to pick the appropriate records to add phone number extension to end user numbers. [Done]</li>\n<li>Eliminate unused phone identity update code from the SMS system, as it was discovered to be outdated and malfunctioning. [To do]</li>\n<li>Clean up any existing user_phone_attributes that were incorrectly created with the sms_capability attribute. [To do]</li>\n<li>Implement an automated test to ensure that sending a message to a Zendesk Text number results in a correctly formatted ticket and new end user creation. This test should simulate calling the end user to ensure their phone number is valid and not appended with an erroneous digit. [To do]</li>\n<li>Develop a more sophisticated alerting system that can differentiate between truly invalid numbers and false positives to minimize unnecessary alerts while still catching legitimate issues.

Try again</strong> is likely due to the presence of a <a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408829589274-Reusing-content-with-content-blocks\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">content block</a> within the article you are attempting to edit.</p>\n<p>Your current subscription plan may not support content blocks. Only Suite and Guide Enterprise plans include this feature.</p>\n<p>To resolve this issue, review the article for any inadvertently added content blocks. If you identify any, remove them from the article. This should enable you to edit the article without encountering the error message again.</p>",
