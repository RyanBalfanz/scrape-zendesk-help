As a service provider to other businesses, we allow and expect our Subscribers to engage in content moderation in line with the <a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408821635610\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Zendesk User Content and Conduct Policy</a>, and their own policies.</p>\n<p>Zendesk uses automated tools to identify and/or filter certain content. These tools are primarily used in the spam context – emails sent to Zendesk customer accounts are run through email spam filters and the spam verdict is used to determine whether incoming emails create tickets or are held in a review queue for customers to review. In addition, comments made on <a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408821635610\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Help Center</a> articles, as well as posts and comments in our <a href=\"https://www.zendesk.com/it/help-center/community-software/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Community</a> product are run through an automated spam filter to detect obvious spam. Zendesk also leverages automated tools to identify and suspend fraudulent accounts by looking at indicators of fraud.</p>\n<p>Zendesk does engage in reactive content moderation upon receiving notice from legal authorities, through reports submitted by members of the public, or through escalations that occur internally. Our content moderation activities are aimed to align with the <a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408821635610\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Zendesk User Content and Conduct Policy</a>, and are conducted by a centralized team within Zendesk of abuse analysts tasked with addressing abuse on Zendesk. This team receives general training upon hire, as well as periodic training on Digital Services Act compliance.</p>\n<p>Content moderation primarily consists of terminating customer accounts, which effectively removes the content, but may also consist of removing the offending content.</p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01JM1059DRPFYXX2B0ZQMJDRSQ\">Zendesk-initiated content moderation by reason</h2>\n<table style=\"border-collapse: collapse; width: 75%;\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 50%;\"><strong>Reason</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 50%;\"><strong>Number</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 50%;\">Spam/phishing</td>\n<td style=\"width: 50%;\">803</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2 id=\"h_01JM109DTCAK9YW3FEBAFQAH67\">Detection methods used</h2>\n<table style=\"border-collapse: collapse; width: 75%;\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 50%;\"><strong>Detection methods</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 50%;\"><strong>Number</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 50%;\">AI detection tool</td>\n<td style=\"width: 50%;\">340</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 50%;\">Abuse analyst observations</td>\n<td style=\"width: 50%;\">463</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h1 id=\"h_01JM10C07YC9D333DT122PVBPZ\">Appeals for redress from affected service recipients</h1>\n<table style=\"border-collapse: collapse; width: 75%;\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 50%;\">Number of complaints received through internal complaint-handling systems</td>\n<td style=\"width: 50%;\">0</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>",

Statuses help users report and filter conversation logs to assess the effectiveness of AI agents.

The end of a session depends on the type of bot used:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>For ticket bots, sessions end after 72 hours</li>\n<li>For chat bots, the session duration depends on the CRM platform.

Therefore, the logic is different. While the original email may show the support address in the CC field, the Zendesk UI moves this address to the To field to indicate which support address the email was sent to.</p>\n<p>Additionally, recipients are moved to the CC field. This lets agents know who their response will be sent back to, and agents can ensure all recipients are included in the email. The same happens in a ticket where the inbound email is sent to any external email address, and the subdomain support email address is CCed.

The new implementation failed to correctly handle NULL values, leading the system to incorrectly identify users as suspended.

The system automatically updates the task status to <strong>Offline</strong> due to network inactivity.</p>\n<p>To mitigate this situation and maintain the status of ongoing tasks, agents can utilize the task lock feature. This feature allows them to lock the task they are currently engaged in when they anticipate that their computer might lose its active internet connection or when there is a lack of activity.</p>\n<p>By locking the task, agents can ensure that their progress is preserved, and the task will not be automatically switched to <strong>Offline</strong> status, allowing for a smoother workflow and minimizing disruptions.</p>\n<p>For further details on how to implement the task lock feature, refer to these articles:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/6443329357210-Activating-task-lock\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Activating task lock</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/6443329257114-Using-task-lock\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Using task lock</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>",

Each restart generated additional metadata in our in-memory database, causing memory bloat until the system eventually ran out of memory, impacting other services that shared the same database instance.<br><br></p>\n<h4 id=\"h_01JJSR8GTXKZTH7451QJ1ZNNW3\"><span style=\"color: #666666;\">Resolution</span></h4>\n<p>To resolve the issue, the team removed unnecessary metadata and unacknowledged keys from the database to free up memory. Additionally, the instance types were increased to accommodate the load, and a successful deployment of the service was completed.<br><br></p>\n<h4 id=\"h_01JJSR8GTX8EPSFVNSPE0ZGJG5\"><span style=\"color: #666666;\">Remediation Items</span></h4>\n<ol>\n<li>Add Alerts: Implemented alerts for Out of Memory (OOM) conditions in the chat service.</li>\n<li>Adjust Memory Limits: Lowered the threshold for memory limits to allow for earlier intervention before reaching critical levels.</li>\n<li>Runbook Improvements: Enhanced documentation and runbooks for handling the chat service and database key management.</li>\n<li>Database Clustering: Planned to separate the database instances for different services to avoid shared memory issues in the future.</li>\n</ol>\n<h4 id=\"01JJSR6R044WBG58MKN9PX5VGG\"><strong>FOR MORE INFORMATION</strong></h4>\n<p class=\"p1\">For current system status information about Zendesk and specific impacts to your account, visit our <a href=\"https://status.zendesk.com\">system status page</a>.
