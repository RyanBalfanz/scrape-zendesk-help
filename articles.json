Any skill on a ticket was treated as required until a <a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4828787357210#topic_ag5_tlr_wbc\">skills timeout</a> occurred. After that point, none of the skills remained in consideration when routing a ticket to an agent.</p>\n<p>Now, skills added by ticket triggers can be configured as either <strong>required</strong> or <strong>optional</strong>. Required skills are skills an agent absolutely must have, while optional skills are nice-to-have and subject to the skills timeout in your omnichannel routing configuration. When a skills timeout occurs and a ticket has both required and optional skills, only the optional skills are dropped from consideration. The required skills are preserved as routing criteria for the ticket, so omnichannel routing will continue to wait for an agent with all of the required skills to become available. </p>\n<p>It's important to note that if you don't configure a skills timeout, all skills are treated as required, regardless of how they're designated in the trigger action that added them.</p>\n<p>For more information, see:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/5833458075930\">Adding and managing skills on tickets</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/5833468891674#topic_d2l_bnx_txb\">About using skills to route tickets</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4828787357210\">Managing your omnichannel routing configuration</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408893545882\">Ticket trigger conditions and actions reference</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"h_01GD3S9GD63FPDGQSEFY88M3ND\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Why is Zendesk making this change?</span></h2>\n<p>We recognize that many customers need to differentiate between skills that are required for a ticket to be successfully and efficiently solved by an agent and skills that are convenient but less critical. Adding this granularity to the skills timeout functionality gives admins more control over how work is routed to agents.</p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01GD3S9TSPXM7M4WHYKYF4E84M\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What do I need to do?</span></h2>\n<p>To begin using this enhancement, make sure you've configured a <a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4828787357210#topic_ag5_tlr_wbc\">skills timeout</a> for omnichannel routing. Then create or update ticket triggers with the <a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408893545882\">add skills or set skills actions</a> and specify whether each skill is required or optional.</p>\n<p>If you have feedback or questions related to this announcement, visit our <a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/community/topics\">community forum</a> where we collect and manage customer product feedback.

Here are some reasons for this issue:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Session interruption: Refreshing the browser breaks the session with the Talk server. This interruption disconnects ongoing calls</li>\n<li>Re-initialization: When you refresh, the browser has to reload resources and re-establish connections. The active call can't be maintained during this process and gets disconnected</li>\n<li>Client-side handling: Talk relies on the client-side application to manage call connections. Refreshing the browser resets the client application, terminating active calls</li>\n<li>WebRTC connection: Talk uses WebRTC (Web Real-Time Communication) for voice calls. Refreshing the browser disrupts the WebRTC connection, causing the call to drop</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>To avoid call disconnections due to browser refreshes</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Avoid refreshing the browser while on a call.</li>\n<li>Open Zendesk in a different window for actions that may require a refresh to avoid affecting the call.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For more information, see these articles:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408829651738-How-can-I-troubleshoot-Talk-issues\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">How can I troubleshoot Talk issues?</a> </li>\n<li><a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408831417498-Talk-network-requirements\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Talk network requirements</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408827413146-What-are-the-most-common-Talk-error-messages\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">What are the most common Talk error messages?</a></li>\n</ul>",

Once you know which topics are necessary to proactively help\n                your customers, you can develop or enhance knowledge base articles to provide the\n                missing information. For example, you can analyze your tickets to find:<ul class=\"ul\" id=\"topic_ixv_zbn_lcc__ul_en2_dgn_lcc\">\n<li class=\"li\">Common issues or pain points that users struggle with</li>\n<li class=\"li\">Frequently asked questions</li>\n<li class=\"li\">Known technical issues and workarounds that impact customers</li>\n<li class=\"li\">Time-consuming issues</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div class=\"p\">Analyzing tickets can be a manual process, and may be overwhelming at first. Having a\n                good strategy helps. Here's one process you can use to analyze your tickets and\n                identify required content: <ul class=\"ul\" id=\"topic_ixv_zbn_lcc__ul_snd_xjn_lcc\">\n<li class=\"li\">\n<strong class=\"ph b\">Categorize your tickets</strong>: How you categorize your tickets depends on\n                        the information you're collecting in tickets. Ideally, you'll want to\n                        categorize by issue, using a custom \"about\" field. Then, you can build an\n                        Explore report to see what your major ticket categories and issues are. See\n                            <a class=\"xref\" href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408828230554-Best-practices-for-finding-customer-issues-to-start-your-knowledge-base#topic_gk5_2hk_lj\" target=\"_blank\">Categorizing your tickets</a>.</li>\n<li class=\"li\">\n<strong class=\"ph b\">Drill-down into ticket groupings to find common issues</strong>: After you\n                        organize your tickets into categories, you'll want to create a view to dig\n                        into the categories with the most tickets and find the common, high\n                        frequency issues.

See <a class=\"xref\" href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408835161114\" target=\"_blank\">Creating and requesting articles in\n                            Knowledge</a>.</li>\n<li class=\"li\">\n<strong class=\"ph b\">Expand article content with generative AI</strong>: If you have the advanced\n                        AI add-on, you can use the text expansion tool within the article editor to\n                        quickly create expanded content for articles. You can write short notes or\n                        bullet points, then use the tool to turn them into complete paragraphs. This\n                        can help you quickly ramp up your help center content. See <a class=\"xref\" href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/6267360002714\" target=\"_blank\">Using generative AI to expand and enhance\n                            help center content</a>.</li>\n<li class=\"li\">\n<strong class=\"ph b\">Determine what to document</strong>: Keep a tracking document where you can\n                        record issues you find, then determine what you want to document and set\n                        priorities for creating the content. Start by identifying 5% of your most\n                        common issues, and focus acting on those first. Taking small steps toward\n                        developing knowledge base content to address ticket issues will yield huge\n                        benefits.

For example, you\n                can analyze the following:<ul class=\"ul\" id=\"topic_xlh_bcn_lcc__ul_gnt_krn_lcc\">\n<li class=\"li\">\n<strong class=\"ph b\">Macros</strong>: If you use macros for common responses to tickets, you can\n                        look at your most used macros to find clues about your common customer pain\n                        points. You can then document the topics covered in those macros in your\n                        knowledge base. Macros that cover known issues and workarounds are a great\n                        resource for creating help articles. </li>\n<li class=\"li\">\n<strong class=\"ph b\">Tags</strong>: You can use the tags on tickets to help pinpoint common issues.\n                        Examine your tag cloud to see the 100 tags that have been most applied to\n                        tickets in the last 30 days. This will help you understand issues that may\n                        require knowledge base articles.</li>\n</ul>\nTo review  macros and tags for common issues, see <a class=\"xref\" href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408828230554-Best-practices-for-finding-customer-issues-to-start-your-knowledge-base#topic_d13_lyd_jj\" target=\"_blank\">Looking at other sources to determine customer\n                    issues</a>.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div aria-labelledby=\"ariaid-title4\" class=\"topic nested1\" id=\"id_y4h_j34_lcc\">\n<h2 class=\"title topictitle2\" id=\"ariaid-title4\">Strategy 3: Review existing content</h2>\n<div class=\"body\">\n<p class=\"p\">Existing content can be another source for determining issues and starting your\n                knowledge base. In most cases, it's ready-made content that can go directly in the\n                knowledge base with little or no editing. </p>\n<p class=\"p\">For example, some agents might have informal documentation, or \"cheat sheets,\" that\n                help them remember common issues and workarounds. Other agents may share information\n                with their team via a wiki, internal help center, or other informal process that you\n                could leverage. </p>\n<p class=\"p\">To review strategies for leveraging your existing content, see <a class=\"xref\" href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408828230554-Best-practices-for-finding-customer-issues-to-start-your-knowledge-base#topic_d13_lyd_jj\" target=\"_blank\">Looking at other sources to determine customer\n                    issues</a>. </p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div aria-labelledby=\"ariaid-title5\" class=\"topic nested1\" id=\"topic_gjf_ccn_lcc\">\n<h2 class=\"title topictitle2\" id=\"ariaid-title5\">Strategy 4: Listen to your community</h2>\n<div class=\"body\">\n<div class=\"p\">To learn about common issues and pain points in your community, you can: <ul class=\"ul\" id=\"topic_gjf_ccn_lcc__ul_ung_3g4_lcc\">\n<li class=\"li\">\n<strong class=\"ph b\">Talk to your agents</strong>: Agents can not only tell you what the common\n                        issues are, but often they can articulate exactly what documentation is\n                        required. Meet with agents regularly and encourage them to suggest new\n                        content and participate in content creation or review, where possible.</li>\n<li class=\"li\">\n<strong class=\"ph b\">Listen to your community</strong>: Check the most active threads for possible\n                        points of confusion. If customers are commenting a lot, it might be a source\n                        of frustration that needs documentation. You can monitor your own help\n                        center community forum, if you have one. If not, you can check third-party\n                        community forums where your customers might be talking about your products\n                        and asking questions (for example, Reddit).</li>\n<li class=\"li\">\n<strong class=\"ph b\">Check social media</strong>: Go everywhere your customers are and find out\n                        what they are saying.

Once the backlog has cleared, tickets will start creating at a normal pace again. Unfortunately there is no ETA or workaround at this time. If you need to access the emails in the meantime, we recommend checking the email inbox of the linked email address.
