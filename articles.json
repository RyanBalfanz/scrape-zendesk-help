Here are some reasons for this issue:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Session interruption: Refreshing the browser breaks the session with the Talk server. This interruption disconnects ongoing calls</li>\n<li>Re-initialization: When you refresh, the browser has to reload resources and re-establish connections. The active call can't be maintained during this process and gets disconnected</li>\n<li>Client-side handling: Talk relies on the client-side application to manage call connections. Refreshing the browser resets the client application, terminating active calls</li>\n<li>WebRTC connection: Talk uses WebRTC (Web Real-Time Communication) for voice calls. Refreshing the browser disrupts the WebRTC connection, causing the call to drop</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>To avoid call disconnections due to browser refreshes</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Avoid refreshing the browser while on a call.</li>\n<li>Open Zendesk in a different window for actions that may require a refresh to avoid affecting the call.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For more information, see these articles:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408829651738-How-can-I-troubleshoot-Talk-issues\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">How can I troubleshoot Talk issues?</a> </li>\n<li><a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408831417498-Talk-network-requirements\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Talk network requirements</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408827413146-What-are-the-most-common-Talk-error-messages\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">What are the most common Talk error messages?</a></li>\n</ul>",

We are looking at ways to reduce the traffic so that the email queue can be processed. Next update expected in 30 minutes.</p>\n<p><strong>August 20, 2024 03:31 AM UTC | August 19, 2024 08:31 PM PT</strong></p>\n<p>We continue to investigate the issue with our email service that is resulting in delayed ticket updates and ticket creation.

Once the backlog has cleared, tickets will start creating at a normal pace again. Unfortunately there is no ETA or workaround at this time. If you need to access the emails in the meantime, we recommend checking the email inbox of the linked email address. We will provide another update when we have one.</p>\n<p><strong>August 20, 2024 10:27 AM UTC | August 20, 2024 03:27 AM PT</strong></p>\n<p>Our team has cleared the backlog, and ticket creation has returned to normal operations. With this, the service incident has been resolved. The backlog has been completed and tickets created or updated in chronological order. All emails impacted by the incident have been reprocessed and none were lost. Please note that you will not need to reconfigure the forwarding integration.

This new API marks the beginning of a phased transition towards replacing the current HC API with a more refined and sophisticated API landscape.</p>\n<p>With the Public API for Media, developers can programmatically manage media resources through a centralized Guide Media Library, a repository designed to handle all media files at the account level.</p>\n<p>Core functionalities include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Create Media: Upload new images and article attachments to the media library with relevant metadata.</li>\n<li>Read Media: Retrieve and view media files and their details.</li>\n<li>Update Media:\n<ul>\n<li>Renaming Media: Update the names of images and article attachments.</li>\n<li>Replacing Media: Replace existing media in all their placements.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Delete Media: Remove outdated or unnecessary media to keep the repository clean.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"h_01GD3S9GD63FPDGQSEFY88M3ND\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Why is Zendesk making this change?</span></h2>\n<p>The Public API for media management is essential for maintaining consistency and branding across various projects. It simplifies media management by offering a centralized repository for monitoring and overseeing all media files. This update will boost efficiency in updating and maintaining media content and foster improved collaboration by providing shared access to media resources. Ultimately, this transition to the new API will empower developers with superior external integration capabilities, paving the way for a more refined and sophisticated API landscape, gradually phasing out the current HC API.</p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01GD3S9TSPXM7M4WHYKYF4E84M\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What do I need to do?</span></h2>\n<p>Customers using the current HC API for media management will need to transition to the new Public API for Media to take advantage of its enhanced functionalities and capabilities. Developers should review <a href=\"https://developer.zendesk.com/api-reference/help_center/help-center-api/guide_medias/\">Guide Medias</a> in the developer documentation to understand how to interact with the new API and make necessary adjustments to their integrations.</p>\n<p>If you have feedback or questions related to this announcement, visit our <a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/community/topics\">community forum</a> where we collect and manage customer product feedback.

Due to an inadequate response to this failure, the Agent-graph component continued to wait up to 60 seconds for a response, causing timeout errors and resulting in 503 service errors. Contributing factors include that the system did not switch to an alternative data source in a timely manner, and the monitors in place did not trigger alerts because the issue was resolved before hitting the thresholds.</p>\n<h3 id=\"h_01J5NBHTBGV0WCS6FRWCSBTSMC\"><span style=\"color: #06363c;\">Resolution</span></h3>\n<p>To fix this issue, the system automatically recovered as the memory-caching system came back online. We identified that the reboot of this system caused the delays, and it was confirmed that the issue was self-resolving, requiring no immediate manual intervention to restore service.</p>\n<h3 id=\"h_01J5NBHTBGD074709AHJQZKPKW\"><span style=\"color: #06363c;\">Remediation Items</span></h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Reduced timeout for user cache retrieval.</li>\n<li>Consider performing chaos testing to simulate such failures in a controlled environment. </li>\n<li>Review and adjust alert thresholds to ensure quicker detection and response time.</li>\n<li>Reach out to AWS to investigate the unexpected reboot of the memory-caching system to prevent similar future occurrences.</li>\n</ol>\n<p class=\"p1\"> </p>\n<h4 id=\"h_01J5NBF60BWVCNNRF6NB11TD0R\"><strong>FOR MORE INFORMATION</strong></h4>\n<p class=\"p1\">For current system status information about your Zendesk, check out our <a href=\"https://status.zendesk.com\">system status page</a>.
