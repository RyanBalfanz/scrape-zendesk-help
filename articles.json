Zendesk enforces this 10K record limit for offset-based pagination to prevent performance issues. Specifically, requests that dig deep into large datasets cause slow response times for the requester and degrade overall system performance.</p><p>As a result, if you continue using the legacy Agent home page:</p><ul>\n<li data-list-item-id=\"ef7f7f1510e27d5c1f25ab5c917555167\">Ticket lists will display a maximum of 10,000 tickets.</li>\n<li data-list-item-id=\"e064720e52e5cd2547c66281956f7a518\">Pagination will be functional only up to page 333.</li>\n<li data-list-item-id=\"eab80ff0b6acae2acbbadd88c0f1f3326\">Requests for pages beyond this limit will trigger an error and redirect you to the first page.</li>\n<li data-list-item-id=\"ec30330ee362f3773e295a38d64d89204\">The last available page will no longer show a <em>Next page</em> button.</li>\n</ul><p>To avoid any disruption or limitations that come with the legacy Agent home page, we encourage all users to start using Agent Home as their primary work space.</p><h2 id=\"h_01K7Q9WSQKYW12525JHHAFZ39H\">Why is Zendesk making this change?</h2><p>Zendesk enforces a 10,000-result limit for offset-based pagination to maintain high system performance and reliability. Deep requests into large datasets can slow response times and negatively impact overall system performance. This limit applies only to the legacy Agent home page, which is used by approximately 2% of customers.</p><h2 id=\"h_01K7Q9WSQKN2G0V0YEMKMSWHBW\">What do I need to do?</h2><p>This change will take effect on December 1, 2025. Most customers are expected to move to the new Agent Home, so only those who opt out and stay on the legacy Agent home page will be affected.</p><p>See <a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/5064623131418\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\">Using Agent Home to manage your work efficiently</span></a> for more information.</p><p>Thank you for your understanding as we improve Zendesk’s platform for everyone.</p><p>If you have feedback or questions related to this announcement, visit our <a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/community/topics/1260801325369\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">community forum</a> where we collect and manage customer product feedback.

It manages calls, chats, queues, and contact flows. Each Contact\n                    Center customer must run a Connect instance in their own AWS account, and a\n                    Contact Center account can link to only one Connect instance. </li>\n<li class=\"li\" dir=\"ltr\">\n<strong class=\"ph b\">Amazon Cognito</strong> is an AWS managed authentication service for web\n                    and mobile apps, handling sign-up, sign-in, and access control. For Contact\n                    Center, it hosts the <em class=\"ph i\">user pool</em> for agents, supervisors, and admins,\n                    securely managing passwords and logins so users can access the Contact Center\n                    app in Zendesk. The integration automatically creates this user pool using\n                    CloudFormation, avoiding a custom identity system.</li>\n<li class=\"li\" dir=\"ltr\">\n<strong class=\"ph b\">Amazon CloudFormation</strong> automates AWS setup with templates,\n                    deploying all resources and permissions for the Connect and Contact Center\n                    integration in a single stack. Think of it as an installer: the stack provisions\n                    and configures the components that let Amazon Connect and the Contact Center app\n                    work together, saving time and reducing errors.</li>\n<li class=\"li\" dir=\"ltr\">\n<strong class=\"ph b\">The Zendesk Contact Center app</strong> is a contact-center-as-a-service\n                    platform from Zendesk that works with Amazon Connect, adding an omnichannel\n                    inbox, AI-assisted tools, and advanced dashboards. Agents sign in to Contact\n                    Center to handle calls and messages, and these are handled by the customer’s own\n                    Connect instance.<p class=\"p\">The app is deployed in the customer’s AWS environment using\n                        CloudFormation, so Contact Center data (for example, call recordings and\n                        customer information) stays in the customer’s environment, not on Zendesk\n                        servers. After linking the Connect instance and deploying the stack, Contact\n                        Center and Connect function as a unified solution.</p>\n</li>\n<li class=\"li\" dir=\"ltr\">\n<strong class=\"ph b\">Dual-stack upgrade process:</strong> Upgrades use a <em class=\"ph i\">dual-stack</em>\n                    approach: instead of updating the existing CloudFormation stack, deploy a new\n                    stack from the latest template, switch Contact Center to it after testing, then\n                    retire the old stack. This ensures a safe rollback point, since in-place\n                    CloudFormation rollbacks can fail (for example, due to permissions). Dual-stack\n                    is the only supported upgrade path. To begin an upgrade, request the updated\n                    template URL from Zendesk and create the new stack in the customer’s AWS\n                    account.</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div aria-labelledby=\"ariaid-title3\" class=\"topic nested1\" id=\"final_cc_set_up_connect\">\n<h2 class=\"title topictitle2\" id=\"ariaid-title3\">Setting up Amazon Connect for Contact Center</h2>\n<div class=\"body\">\n<p class=\"p\" dir=\"ltr\">Amazon Connect is the platform on which Zendesk Contact Center runs.

We appreciate your patience during this time and urge you to contact us if the issue persists.</p><p><strong>November 10, 2025 14:02 UTC | November 10, 2025 06:02 AM PT</strong></p><p>We would like to inform you that the emergency maintenance window has been extended from 15:00 UTC to 17:00 UTC to allow our engineers to fully restore import functionality for customers in the US cluster. We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause and appreciate your patience as we continue to work diligently. Updates will be provided as they become available.</p><p><strong>November 07, 2025 16:22 UTC | November 07, 2025 08:22 AM PT</strong></p><p>As part of our ongoing efforts to resolve the issue impacting customers using AI Agents, our engineers will perform emergency maintenance on Monday, November 10, 2025. The maintenance is expected to last approximately 4 hours, from 11:00 to 15:00 UTC. During this period imports will be unavailable for customers operating on the US cluster. We will update when the maintenance is complete or if we have new information. We appreciate your understanding and apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.</p><p><strong>November 06, 2025 16:58 UTC | November 06, 2025 08:58 AM PT</strong></p><p>Our engineering team has restored manual import functionality for all AI Agents bots affected by the incident. We apologize for the disruption and sincerely appreciate your patience while we continue working toward a complete resolution. We will continue to provide updates until the incident is fully resolved.</p><p><strong>November 06, 2025 14:37 UTC | November 06, 2025 06:37 AM PT</strong></p><p>Our engineers have completed the phased rollout of manual imports and will now proceed with enabling imports on a randomized basis for remaining customers.

Imports remain temporarily disabled for most EU bots created prior to October 9, 2025, to protect system stability, and no immediate workaround is available. Imports for US bots and EU bots created after this date are functioning as expected. We advise against EU customers creating US bots due to compliance issues. For urgent cases, please contact Customer Support. We regret any inconvenience caused and will continue to provide updates via the Help Center.</p><p><strong>November 04, 2025 13:17 UTC | November 04, 2025 05:17 AM PT</strong></p><p>Our engineers continue to work on resolving the issue affecting AI Agents.

We apologize for the inconvenience and assure you that our team is diligently addressing the matter. Updates will be provided as they become available.</p><p><strong>October 31, 2025 12:59 UTC | October 31, 2025 05:59 AM PT</strong><br>Our engineering team will continue their work into next week to address the issue affecting AI Agents.

We apologize for any interruption and thank you for your continued patience.<br><br><strong>October 31, 2025 12:59 UTC | October 31, 2025 05:59 AM PT</strong></p><p>While our engineers have addressed the data import and retrieval delays affecting AI Agents, they continue working on a permanent solution. As a temporary workaround, creating new bots has been tested and shown to help. We apologize for any inconvenience caused and appreciate your ongoing patience. We will share updates as soon as more information becomes available.</p><p><strong>October 29, 2025 16:42 UTC | October 29, 2025 09:42 AM PT</strong></p><p>Our engineers have confirmed that the Search and Observability service is now stable, and the issue causing delays in data import and retrieval within AI Agents has been resolved.

This unusually high request volume caused database and server resource exhaustion leading to delays in event processing. This was exacerbated by cross-service latencies, especially in Support. As a result, customers experienced service slow-downs, errors, and significant delays in receiving and sending messages as well as ticket creation delays. These latencies also impacted associated API endpoints that may have caused impact to apps and integrations leveraging those services.</p><h3 id=\"h_01K8VTEDY0QBSK82DXRHQ35EWY\"><span style=\"color: #06363c;\">Resolution</span></h3><p>To fix this issue, our teams increased infrastructure capacity by scaling up our databases and processing systems to handle the traffic and clear our messaging backlogs. In addition, we adjusted system configurations to improve processing speed and to increase system resiliency for these sudden traffic spikes.</p><h3 id=\"h_01K8VTEJJF990YQKF7E709YTNE\"><span style=\"color: #06363c;\">Remediation Items</span></h3><ol>\n<li data-list-item-id=\"ea25532f0d0f3f483cbdea52483bac60c\">Improve system monitoring and alerting to improve detection times.</li>\n<li data-list-item-id=\"ea38795d0c73196ae397339facf25996e\">Enhance infrastructure scalability so our systems can better handle sudden increases in demand.</li>\n<li data-list-item-id=\"e48ff8df0f6869b2b4e74e4e291e26643\">Review and optimize rate limit strategies to prevent platform overload.</li>\n<li data-list-item-id=\"ec518427fb1d83806529cab76f44ca1a3\">Strengthening cross-region coordination to reduce the risk of delays when one part of the system is impacted.</li>\n</ol><h4 id=\"h_01K086AN7TN2VXG8HZSHSSG4DT\"><strong>FOR MORE INFORMATION</strong></h4><p>For current system status information about Zendesk and specific impacts to your account, visit our <a href=\"https://status.zendesk.com/\">system status page</a>.

These challenges affected how smoothly tickets were managed and caused some disruptions in automated and manual processes.</p><h3 class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-justify\" id=\"h_01K8ST85AXPH1BA7SFXJCMXNX1\"><span style=\"color: #06363c;\"><strong>Timeline</strong></span></h3><p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-justify\"><strong>October 22, 2025 17:57 UTC | October 22, 2025 10:57 AM PT</strong></p><p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-justify\">We have identified an issue with the AI Agent tickets rollout. We have had customers report issues with tickets not being escalated to Agents when they should have been. We have also received reports that AI-Agent tickets are created an AI Agent is not configured. The latter issue can be caused when basic responders are acting on pre-agent conversations. We recommend if you are seeing issues with AI Agent tickets to disable the feature following the steps here. We will provide updates as they become available.</p><p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-justify\"><strong>October 22, 2025 20:00 UTC | October 22, 2025 12:00 PM PT</strong></p><p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-justify\">Our team continues to investigate the issue with AI Agent tickets escalation and routing functionality related to the AI Agent ticket rollout. Our recommendation remains to disable this functionality following the steps here if any issues are encountered. We apologize for any disruption this may cause, and thank you for your patience.</p><p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-justify\"><strong>October 22, 2025 21:40 UTC | October 22, 2025 1:40 PM PT</strong></p><p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-justify\">While we have identified a small subset of customers with advanced routing configurations who experienced impact due to this incident, the majority of customers should not experience any difficulty with AI Agent ticket functionality. If you encounter any routing or escalation issues with AI Agent tickets, please reach out to our Support team for follow up and assistance in resolving these issues. Thank you for your patience during our investigation.</p><h3 class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-justify\" id=\"h_01K8ST4XQBRFNQ1ZAQXTQGBGSD\"><span style=\"color: #06363c;\"><strong>Root Cause Analysis</strong></span></h3><p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-justify\">This incident was caused by a mix of software errors and gaps in the rollout process of the new pre-agent tickets feature. The main problems involved errors in how tickets were moved between stages, incorrect information from an external system, and timing issues that led to duplicate tickets. Incomplete reversal steps and setup oversights also contributed to the ongoing difficulties. Additionally, there were not enough early warnings or checks in place to catch these issues before they affected customers.</p><h3 class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-justify\" id=\"h_01K8ST4XQCV0A2XYT4MF0G48K9\"><span style=\"color: #06363c;\"><strong>Resolution</strong></span></h3><p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-justify\">To fix this issue, the team temporarily turned off the new feature for affected customers while working on fixes. They corrected data errors, improved how tickets were assigned and moved, and made other process improvements. The feature rollout then restarted slowly with extra precautions. For some customers, manual adjustments were made to fix ticket details and restore normal service.</p><h3 class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-justify\" id=\"h_01K8ST4XQJKQE53NG7Y2CRND9P\"><span style=\"color: #06363c;\"><strong>Remediation Items</strong></span></h3><ol>\n<li data-list-item-id=\"e429507127aebe0c288b4c1137ad3d172\"><p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-justify\">Standardize the information used during ticket updates to prevent errors.</p></li>\n<li data-list-item-id=\"ea68371e26a4710a30717b8c7f87f2bee\"><p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-justify\">Improve how ticket assignments are tracked to reduce the need for manual work.</p></li>\n<li data-list-item-id=\"e91f3426dca8c07687e63240f90421dd5\"><p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-justify\">Ensure important customer details are correctly added when tickets are passed on.</p></li>\n<li data-list-item-id=\"eb13d67920123b981dd2e7c3a69d780e1\"><p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-justify\">Adjust processes to avoid creating duplicate tickets due to timing issues.</p></li>\n<li data-list-item-id=\"e4987aa042707fab8bb15dcacad5ef668\"><p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-justify\">Refine how new features are introduced and removed, with clear steps for turning them off safely.</p></li>\n<li data-list-item-id=\"ef89e01cd7b15e7ba87ce2234c4397365\"><p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-justify\">Set up monitoring and alerts to identify problems quickly before they affect customers.</p></li>\n<li data-list-item-id=\"e8a2c7c0c05217c08f91f316079e2a616\"><p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-justify\">Improve guides and communication about the feature’s purpose and management.</p></li>\n<li data-list-item-id=\"eea042fe600bce624ee296d1a8f4030e6\"><p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-justify\">Enhance testing methods, especially for safely reversing changes if needed.</p></li>\n<li data-list-item-id=\"ee56b032ecc1d2200b66bc54b9d8bcdfb\"><p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-justify\">Review the rollout approach to release updates in smaller, controlled stages by region or customer group to minimize impact.</p></li>\n</ol><h4 class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-justify\" id=\"h_01K086AN7TN2VXG8HZSHSSG4DT\"><strong>FOR MORE INFORMATION</strong></h4><p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-justify\">For current system status information about Zendesk and specific impacts to your account, visit our <a href=\"https://status.zendesk.com/\">system status page</a>.
