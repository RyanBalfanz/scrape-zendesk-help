How do I buy additional agent seats?</p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01HYBAYSYEBM197897FQ8P2KW9\">Answer</h2>\n<p>You can purchase additional agent seats as needed, or when your last agent seat is used. Only the account owner and billing admins can buy more seats. Admins who aren't the account owner or a billing admin can <a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408828513434\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">request a subscription change</a> to add agent seats.</p>\n<p>The ability to add agent seats depends on your account type. For sales-assisted accounts that can't instantly buy agent seats, you'll see a form to request more agents. The request is sent to your sales representative and a service order will be created on your behalf.</p>\n<p>See the video below for a guide on how to add agent seats to your Zendesk account.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"//www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Ta5SjXRYFnM\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></p>\n<p>For more information, see the article: <a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408881540506\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Adding agent seats to your subscription</a>.</p>",

This affected users trying to connect to core services like the Agent Activity Tracker, resulting in performance issues.  </p>\n<h4 id=\"h_01J3HT0Z48VAZVEKQ98TJTTXTN\" class=\"p1\"><strong>Timeline</strong></h4>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>July 17, 2024 12:28 PM UTC | July 17, 2024 05:28 AM PT</strong></p>\n<p class=\"undefined\">Unfortunately, we experienced the similar issues again today, resulting in another spike in errors with some of the same symptoms. Clearing your cache or using an incognito window should resolve the issue. We will be monitoring errors for the next 24 hours, and if there are no further occurrences, the new incident will be merged into this one. Thank you for your patience and understanding.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>July 16, 2024 04:32 PM UTC | July 16, 2024 09:32 AM PT </strong><br>We've received multiple customer confirmations that clearing cache and cookies has restored access to Zendesk WFM and will be marking this incident as fully resolved.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>July 16, 2024 02:38 PM UTC | July 16, 2024 07:38 AM PT </strong><br>We have observed that the errors on the backend have subsided. We kindly request that you clear your cache and cookies and then confirm whether things are working as expected.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>July 16, 2024 01:59 PM UTC | July 16, 2024 06:59 AM PT </strong><br>In addition to the general platform errors mentioned previously, some customers are also unable to load the WFM widget correctly within Support and the Chrome extension, across multiple Pods.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>July 16, 2024 01:42 PM UTC | July 16, 2024 06:42 AM PT </strong><br>Upon receiving negative confirmation from customers regarding the resolution of the issues, we continue to investigate the problem with Zendesk WFM (formerly Tymeshift). A subset of customers are still seeing the errors “You don’t have access to this feature” and “Something didn’t work / Give it a moment and try again” when trying to access the organization structure. We will provide more information in 1 hour or as soon as we have additional details to share.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>July 16, 2024 01:06 PM UTC | July 16, 2024 06:06 AM PT </strong><br>We are currently seeing improvements in the backend handling of traffic for the impacted accounts, and these accounts should now be able to start loading Zendesk WFM within Zendesk.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>July 16, 2024 12:39 PM UTC | July 16, 2024 05:39 AM PT </strong><br>We are currently investigating reports of slowness or inability to load Zendesk WFM (formerly known as Tymeshift) for some customers across multiple Pods. We will provide more updates in 30 minutes or as soon as we have more details.</p>\n</div>\n<p class=\"p1\"> </p>\n<h3 id=\"h_01J3HT1Z71MZWWG0P6TMS086JW\" class=\"p1\"><strong>POST-MORTEM</strong></h3>\n<p>Due to a configuration limit, some of our network traffic exceeded the maximum allowed usage during peak times. This wasn't immediately visible, and the resultant delays impacted the customer experience. Once aware, we worked quickly to increase this limit and adjust our configuration to better handle traffic.</p>\n<h4 id=\"h_01J3HT372D5PN4RRS94S4T2F1P\"><strong>Root Cause Analysis</strong></h4>\n<p>The root cause was a default setting that limited the number of communication channels available, which we exceeded as our customer base and traffic grew.</p>\n<h4 id=\"h_01J3HT3K6QTVJWRCT807GN11ME\"><strong>Resolution</strong></h4>\n<p>By increasing the capacity and reconfiguring the appropriate settings, we have resolved the underlying issue. Additional steps were taken to ensure continued stability.</p>\n<h4 id=\"h_01J3HT3T4T7PG341DBSQWG8QE2\"><strong>Remediation</strong></h4>\n<p>To prevent similar issues in the future, we are implementing the following measures:</p>\n<p>1. Capacity Monitoring: We are adding proactive monitoring to alert us when we approach capacity limits.<br>2. Configuration Reviews: We are reviewing and adjusting our configurations across all regions to ensure they are prepared for increased traffic.<br>3. Improved Response Plans: We are strengthening our incident response procedures to quickly diagnose and resolve any future issues.</p>\n<h4 id=\"h_01J3HT372D00ZX6V9VWF0370YK\"> </h4>\n<h4 id=\"h_01J30AWQ6N8EQS8HWVW6EXD5JN\"><strong>FOR MORE INFORMATION</strong></h4>\n<p class=\"p1\">For current system status information about your Zendesk, check out our <a href=\"https://status.zendesk.com\">system status page</a>.

However, I've noticed that the number of solved and closed tickets displayed can sometimes differ depending on the user, and it does not match the requester's actual solved tickets. Can you explain why this happens?</p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01HYBAYSYEBM197897FQ8P2KW9\">Answer</h2>\n<p>The difference in the number of solved and closed tickets is due to how the app handles archived tickets based on the number of tickets a user has.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Users with less than 100 tickets: The app excludes archived, solved, and closed tickets from the count. This means that the displayed numbers only reflect tickets that are not archived.</li>\n<li>Users with 100 or more tickets: The app includes archived, solved, and closed tickets in the count. Thus, the numbers shown include all tickets, both active and archived.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The app is designed this way to optimize performance and minimize load on our platform. By excluding archived tickets for users with fewer tickets, the app ensures faster data retrieval and reduces unnecessary processing. For users with a larger volume of tickets, including archived tickets ensures comprehensive data representation without significantly impacting performance.</p>\n<p>For more information about ticket archiving, see the article: <a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408887617050-About-ticket-archiving\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">About ticket archiving</a>.</p>",

Since a single system cannot accommodate all needs, Support apps offer a powerful way to incorporate new use cases and create connected customer experiences.</p>\n<p>For more information on Support top bar apps, see <a href=\"https://developer.zendesk.com/documentation/apps/app-design-guidelines/support/topbar-apps-support/\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\" style=\"color: #1155cc;\">Top bar apps</span></a> in our developer documentation. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/7612166489882\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-07-15 at 12.15.50 PM.png\"></p>\n<p>Visual changes include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The removal of the grayscale border surrounding each top bar app, replaced with a gray fill for a simpler, more consistent style. </li>\n<li>The arrow pointing to the selected top bar app is now positioned at the end of the app container, preventing the container from extending beyond the right side of the app icon.</li>\n<li>A close button has been added to the tooltip modal that appears when a top bar app is selected. This addition enhances accessibility, making the top bar app modal usable for all users, particularly those who rely on keyboard navigation, and aligns with Zendesk’s current target of <a href=\"https://www.zendesk.com/company/agreements-and-terms/accessibility/\">2.1 AA accessibility standards</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/7612763139482\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-07-15 at 2.17.09 PM.png\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01GD3S9GD63FPDGQSEFY88M3ND\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Why is Zendesk making this change?</span></h2>\n<p>As part of Zendesk's broader React Migration Initiative (RMI) to transition the Support frontend to React for enhanced product reliability, improved developer productivity, and easier automated testing, <a href=\"https://developer.zendesk.com/documentation/apps/app-design-guidelines/support/topbar-apps-support/\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\" style=\"color: #1155cc;\">Top bar apps</span></a> in support have now been migrated from Ember to React. This migration aligns with our goal of achieving One Zendesk, standardizing our approach to building features - whether in terms of database storage, API methodology, or in this case, our Javascript framework.</p>\n<p>Currently, half of Zendesk uses Ember, while the other half uses React. React offers numerous advantages:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Developers are more productive and can address issues and develop new features more quickly because we primarily hire React developers, and the language is inherently more composable.</li>\n<li>Migrating entirely to React enhances reliability and stability because:\n<ul>\n<li>Communication between Ember and React is more error-prone.</li>\n<li>It allows us to write automated tests much more efficiently.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"01J2M7Z6ZYK7SHY9P4JFE137G3\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What do I need to do?</span></h2>\n<p>There should only be a small frontend change with no functional impact on how your apps and apps support APIs work. The top bar app UI in both the app session and the system icon session has been slightly modernized and made more accessible with the latest <a href=\"https://garden.zendesk.com/\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\" style=\"color: #1155cc;\">Garden</span></a> components. Functionally, everything should remain the same.</p>\n<p>If you notice any differences in how apps or the rest of the agent experience functions in your account, please let us know.</p>\n<p>There’s no action required from you. This update is automatically rolled out and available to all accounts.</p>\n<p>For more information on design recommendations and achieving a consistent look and feel, please see our <a href=\"https://developer.zendesk.com/documentation/apps/app-design-guidelines/support/topbar-apps-support/\">Top bar apps (Support) </a>guide in the Zendesk developer documentation.</p>\n<p>If you have feedback or questions related to this announcement, visit our <a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/community/topics/1260801854190-Zendesk-Apps-framework-ZAF-\">community forum</a> where we collect and manage customer product feedback.

Moving forward, scheduled dashboard deliveries can be <a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/6844667123610\">viewed directly from the Dashboards library</a> (in the Schedules column), and a detailed view of scheduled deliveries is available on the dashboard itself under the <strong>Schedule</strong> button.</p>\n<p>Additionally, with this update, only users with admin permissions in Explore will be able to see the Settings icon and access the admin settings pages. Editors will no longer see the Settings icon in the sidebar.</p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01J2KRK65DBQ40K7WQMK76C2D8\">What do I need to do?</h2>\n<p>There's no action required of you.

This impacts customers who have migrated to the Omnichannel Backend Routing. In order to ensure your agent's names are sent in chat and messaging with only their intended alias you will need to perform the following actions: 1. Set a Support alias in addition to your Chat display name 2. Update Chat shortcuts to not use {{agent_name}} Our teams are reviewing this behavior and we will provide further updates as they become available.

This was due to a disruption impacting Webhooks on Messenger API for Instagram, which affected all Sunshine Conversations and Messaging accounts integrated with Instagram. We detected the issue promptly and worked with Meta to resolve it. Unfortunately, messages sent during the incident were lost and could not be recovered.</p>\n<h3 id=\"h_01J2ZRTBB8861W2Q3R6GTAC95M\" class=\"p1\"><strong>Timeline</strong></h3>\n<p class=\"undefined\"><strong>July 16, 2024 04:44 PM  UTC | July 11, 2024 09:44 AM PT <br></strong>We’ve been informed by our partner that messages that were sent during the incident between 2024-07-11 15:56 UTC to 2024-07-12 00:00 UTC that were lost due to the configuration change cannot be recovered. Unfortunately, it is not possible to backfill messages that were sent during the incident.<strong><br></strong></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>July 12, 2024 01:23 AM UTC | July 11, 2024 06:23 PM PT </strong><br>We have confirmation that the issue previously preventing Instagram messages from being received has been resolved.

Messages to the Instagram channel should now be able to be received.

This resulted in Meta temporarily stopping the delivery of webhooks, which are essential for processing Instagram messages. This affected all users with Instagram integrations. We escalated the issue to Meta and worked closely with them to restore service.</p>\n<h4 id=\"h_01J2ZRZ319T2JG3JKX8XSGB7YH\"><strong>Root Cause Analysis</strong></h4>\n<p id=\"h_01J2ZRZSPHKEHSSSPTP7EV20H5\">Sunshine Conversations relies on Webhooks from Instagram to process messages. When Meta stopped sending these Webhooks, we were unable to process any Instagram messages. The root cause was a configuration change on Meta's side, which they later confirmed.</p>\n<h4 id=\"h_01J2ZRX99PVW2X6EFT86DCJSGM\"><strong>Resolution</strong></h4>\n<p>We escalated the issue with Meta until the issue was acknowledged and resolved. Meta resumed sending webhooks, and normal service was restored.</p>\n<h4 id=\"h_01J2ZRX0ZP3TTYWJ77K10QBW6J\"><strong>Remediation Items<br></strong></h4>\n<ol>\n<li>Improve Escalation Processes: We will review and update our escalation policies to ensure faster resolution in the future.</li>\n<li>Monitor Enhancements: We will enhance our monitoring systems to better detect and respond to similar issues.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>We apologize for any inconvenience this incident may have caused and appreciate your understanding as we work to improve our processes.</p>\n<h4 id=\"h_01J2Y6RY4TZQ9D6KT66AMPA9DC\"><strong><br>FOR MORE INFORMATION</strong></h4>\n<p class=\"p1\">For current system status information about your Zendesk, check out our <a href=\"https://status.zendesk.com\">system status page</a>.

This change inadvertently caused some published articles to be republished without user intervention, resulting in some draft versions of articles to be inadvertently published.</p>\n<h4 id=\"h_01J2ZS11SQPD7EPFGM1KH87GW6\" class=\"p1\"><strong>Timeline</strong></h4>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>July 09, 2024 08:41 PM UTC | July 09, 2024 01:41 PM PT </strong><br>Our engineers have identified the issue and rolled back the affecting change across all pods. Guide article editing, saving, and publishing have been restored to normal behavior. Please note: If you saved any article edits between 11:40 UTC to 20:37 UTC, you may have inadvertently published draft article content. You will need to manually restore the previous published version by either using the Guide article revision history feature or manually updating the article and republishing.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>July 09, 2024 07:57 PM UTC | July 09, 2024 12:57 PM PT </strong><br>We have confirmed an issue with editing published Guide articles wherein clicking \"save\" inadvertently publishes the article live instead of only \"saving\" the current article draft version. We are working on reverting a change to restore the normal behavior. We will provide another update in 30 minutes or when have new information to share.</p>\n<p class=\"undefined\"> </p>\n</div>\n<h3 id=\"h_01J2ZS347YH59FYXMAJ99QK1WM\" class=\"p1\"><strong>POST-MORTEM</strong></h3>\n<h4 id=\"h_01J2ZS1R96DJKVC3K30VNW82NS\">Root Cause Analysis</h4>\n<p>An update intended to improve our editing system inadvertently caused edits to be processed twice, once through the old system and once through the new one. This led to articles being republished unnecessarily.</p>\n<h4 id=\"h_01J2ZS1W2MDAHQX8ZCHRFXKG48\">Resolution</h4>\n<p>Upon identifying the issue, we implemented a fix to disable the problematic feature. The system was stabilized, and normal operations resumed.</p>\n<h4 id=\"h_01J2ZS1Z9WV88WKE8TG9S074W2\">Remediation Items</h4>\n<p>We have identified several steps to prevent similar incidents in the future:</p>\n<p>1. Ensure commands within our system are side-effect free.<br>2. Separate the republishing logic for different customer tiers.<br>3. Enhance our pre-deployment testing to better capture such issues.</p>\n<p>We apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused and appreciate your understanding as we strive to improve our services.</p>\n<h4 id=\"h_01J2ZS1R96QT1MA50Q0QG0X12Z\"> </h4>\n<h4 id=\"h_01J2YARY82SQ3H8PEWPR1X175Y\"><strong>FOR MORE INFORMATION</strong></h4>\n<p class=\"p1\">For current system status information about your Zendesk, check out our <a href=\"https://status.zendesk.com\">system status page</a>.

      "body": "<h2 id=\"h_01HYBAYSYE6D5MS9R76RP14V1N\">Question</h2>\n<p>Why am I getting a <code>409</code> conflict error when authenticating users via Messaging JWT authentication?</p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01HYBAYSYEBM197897FQ8P2KW9\">Answer</h2>\n<p><code>409</code> errors in messaging JWT authentication indicate that the <code>AppUserID</code> assigned to a specific user <code>external_ID</code> is already being used in the system. Due to this conflict, the current user who tries to log in via JWT authentication can't be authenticated.</p>\n<p>For example, this error can occur when an existing Zendesk user with an external_ID 1234 was updated and the <code>external_ID</code> of the user changed, for example 123456. Both the user in Zendesk and the payload will have the same information, same email, and same external_ID. When trying to authenticate the user however, the email registered for that user will be linked to an <code>AppUserID</code> in Sunshine Conversation. Zendesk will only allow the authentication of the user with the previous external_ID, 1234.</p>\n<p>To resolve this behaviour and allow users with an updated <code>external_ID</code> to log in via JWT authentication, you must delete the previous <code>AppUserID</code> linked to the first <code>external_ID</code>.</p>\n<p>With Suite Professional and above plans, make an API call:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Basic authentication</strong>, use an <a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4576088682266-Using-the-Conversations-API-keys#:~:text=To%20create%20and%20share%20an,Click%20Create%20API%20key.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">API key and a secret key</a>.\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Username</strong>: <code>API_KEY_ID</code>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Password</strong>: <code>API_KEY_SECRET</code>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>API method</strong>: <code>DELETE</code>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>URL for European accounts</strong>: <code>https://api.eu-1.smooch.io/v2/apps/{appId}/users/{userIdOrExternalId}</code>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>URL for the rest of the world</strong>: <code>https://api.smooch.io/v2/apps/{appId}/users/{userIdOrExternalId}</code><br>Within the above URLs, replace the <code>{appId}</code> with the ID provided when generating the API key and secret key, and replace the <code>{userIdOrExternalId}</code> with the previous <code>external_ID</code> linked to the user who returns the error.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"p\">\n<div class=\"note note\">\n<span class=\"notetitle\"><strong>Disclaimer</strong>:</span> This article is provided for instructional purposes only.

This was due to a change in our system that inadvertently caused an error, impacting the availability of these recordings. Once the issue was identified, we reverted the change, restoring normal service.</p>\n<div id=\"message-list\">\n<h4 id=\"h_01J2DR6JA2R8R1HDQ4KDEFNF1S\" class=\"undefined\"><strong>Timeline<br></strong></h4>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>July 05, 2024 01:52 PM UTC | July 05, 2024 06:52 AM PT<br></strong>Changes were successfully reverted to the previous working state. Logs indicate that our recovery process is functioning and should recover recordings within the next couple of hours. Please allow time for the system to process any previously unavailable recordings. A simple page or browser refresh/update may be required. Thank you for your patience while we worked on this.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>July 05, 2024 01:31 PM UTC | July 05, 2024 06:31 AM PT </strong><br>We are currently aware of and working on reverting recent changes that have impacted Talk customers, causing “Call recordings” to be unavailable across multiple Pods. The next update will be provided in 30 minutes.</p>\n</div>\n<h3 id=\"h_01J2CE2M72E3KBZSRKQ9AN08GW\" class=\"p1\"><strong><br>POST-MORTEM</strong></h3>\n<h4 id=\"h_01J2DR3N4321MGQB6HDZ4BPCQ7\" class=\"undefined\"><strong>Root Cause Analysis</strong></h4>\n<p class=\"undefined\">The issue was caused by a change in our system configuration that affected how call recordings were stored. Specifically, a setting was altered that directed our service to an incorrect storage location, resulting in errors when trying to save call recordings.</p>\n<h4 id=\"h_01J2DR3R7PPAJVYF5N237D1H65\"><strong>Resolution</strong></h4>\n<p>Upon identifying the issue, we quickly reverted the change that caused the problem. This rollback restored the correct configuration, and our service resumed normal operation.</p>\n<h4 id=\"h_01J2DR3V87XN0SBMBJ3HJNK8B5\"><strong>Remediation</strong></h4>\n<p>To prevent this from happening again, we are taking the following steps:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Improved Testing: We will enhance our testing processes to catch similar issues before they reach production.</li>\n<li>Configuration Management: We will update our system to use separate settings for different services, ensuring that changes to one service do not inadvertently impact another.</li>\n<li>Monitoring and Alerts: We will improve our monitoring and alerting systems to detect and respond to issues more quickly.</li>\n</ol>\n<h4 id=\"h_01J2CDA4B7BNCA6EZZPHNVQ2D2\"><strong><br>FOR MORE INFORMATION</strong></h4>\n<p class=\"p1\">For current system status information about your Zendesk, check out our <a href=\"https://status.zendesk.com\">system status page</a>.
