This gives you an instant overview of your queues, helping you understand the volume of work awaiting available agents and the average time work items spend in each queue.</p>\n<p>We have included basic data about your OCR queues that you can view in the new component:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Queue name</li>\n<li>Queue order</li>\n<li>Work in the queue</li>\n<li>Primary groups serving the queue</li>\n<li>Average time work item spends in the queue spread by channel</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can filter these data by following filters:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Primary groups</li>\n<li>Queue name</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"https://zen-marketing-documentation.s3.amazonaws.com/docs/en/explore_queues_live_reporting.png\" width=\"600\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01HX9EEPWWWQ8K4Q9TH6W42XYB\">How will this affect me?</h2>\n<p>The live omnichannel queues reporting feature provides you with real-time insights into your custom omnichannel queues. This helps you better manage your queues and understand their performance in real time. If you’ve turned on OCR and created custom queues, then you can add the new component to your dashboard.</p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01HX9EESX89B25YG7RA1P7N30C\">What do I need to do?</h2>\n<p>No action is required from you.

Why did it stop firing for some of the tickets?<br><img src=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/7216335019418\" alt=\"hours since.png\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01HX725H5CHEC1BNWDF317AM6C\">Answer</h2>\n<p>This problem arises because the <strong>Hours since | Is</strong> condition is very restrictive. Automations run every hour but not necessarily top-of-the-hour or at the same time each hour. For example, you can have a condition in which tickets were assigned 5 hours ago. If you assign the ticket at 10:03, and the automation fires at 15:01, then the ticket was only assigned 4 hours and 58 minutes ago and the automation isn't yet true. If the next time the automation fires is 16:06, then the ticket was assigned 6 hours and 3 minutes ago, and the condition fails again.</p>\n<p>To avoid this issue, we recommend using <strong>Hours since | Greater than</strong> because it offers a bigger time window in which the condition is valid. However, you must also define a <a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408832701850-About-automations-and-how-they-work#topic_mbl_q4f_tm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">nullifying condition or action</a> to ensure <strong>Greater than</strong> conditions are true only once for a ticket.</p>\n<p>For more information, see these articles:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408836495130-Using-the-Hours-since-condition-in-automations#topic_ld3_5d1_tqb\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Using \"Hours since...is\" conditions</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408832701850-About-automations-and-how-they-work#:~:text=last%2014%20days.-,Understanding%20when%20automation%20actions%20fire,-Automations%20run%20in\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Understanding when automation actions fire</a></li>\n</ul>"

For the most recent offerings, see <a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408846483482\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Zendesk Talk number availability and pricing</a> and use the provided dropdown menu.</li>\n<li>Ensure that agents are <a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408823796890\">taking calls through the browser</a> rather than using phones to avoid additional costs.</li>\n<li>Promote the <a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408884087706-Enabling-customer-callback\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">callback option</a> to customers. Callback requests don't incur costs while customers are waiting, unlike costs that accumulate when callers remain on hold.</li>\n<li>Implement <a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408830696090-Understanding-Talk-Embedded-voice\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">digital lines</a>, such as a call button on your website or mobile app, enabling customers to contact support over the internet rather than through traditional phone lines.</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408836253338\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Analyze the volume and costs</a> of abandoned calls each month and devise strategies to decrease these occurrences.</li>\n<li>Regularly access and export data from your <a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408825620378-Reviewing-your-Talk-usage-charges\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">usage charges</a> for a detailed breakdown of your charges. Input the dates from your Talk invoice and obtain specific usage information. Export the report to CSV for an in-depth analysis. You will be able to identify the most expensive calls and evaluate whether your current setup is cost-effective.</li>\n<li>Redirect calls to self-service options like a knowledge base, <a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4598810401562-How-can-I-send-an-automatic-text-when-customers-call-in\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">SMS or messaging</a> and other self-service channels. Reserve voice calls to handle complex customer issues.</li>\n<li>If you already are a Zendesk customer, use the <a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408846483482-Zendesk-Talk-number-availability-and-pricing#h_b03191e2-5c41-40f5-81bb-9752cb9de841\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">package discounts on Talk credit</a>.

However, agents and admins still see the community from your help center.</p>\n<p>To remove the hyperlink to your community from the help center instead, edit your help center theme.
