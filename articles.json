Why did it stop firing for some of the tickets?<br><img src=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/7216335019418\" alt=\"hours since.png\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01HX725H5CHEC1BNWDF317AM6C\">Answer</h2>\n<p>This problem arises because the <strong>Hours since | Is</strong> condition is very restrictive. Automations run every hour but not necessarily top-of-the-hour or at the same time each hour. For example, you can have a condition in which tickets were assigned 5 hours ago. If you assign the ticket at 10:03, and the automation fires at 15:01, then the ticket was only assigned 4 hours and 58 minutes ago and the automation isn't yet true. If the next time the automation fires is 16:06, then the ticket was assigned 6 hours and 3 minutes ago, and the condition fails again.</p>\n<p>To avoid this issue, we recommend using <strong>Hours since | Greater than</strong> because it offers a bigger time window in which the condition is valid. However, you must also define a <a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408832701850-About-automations-and-how-they-work#topic_mbl_q4f_tm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">nullifying condition or action</a> to ensure <strong>Greater than</strong> conditions are true only once for a ticket.</p>\n<p>For more information, see these articles:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408836495130-Using-the-Hours-since-condition-in-automations#topic_ld3_5d1_tqb\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Using \"Hours since...is\" conditions</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408832701850-About-automations-and-how-they-work#:~:text=last%2014%20days.-,Understanding%20when%20automation%20actions%20fire,-Automations%20run%20in\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Understanding when automation actions fire</a></li>\n</ul>"

For the most recent offerings, see <a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408846483482\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Zendesk Talk number availability and pricing</a> and use the provided dropdown menu.</li>\n<li>Ensure that agents are <a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408823796890\">taking calls through the browser</a> rather than using phones to avoid additional costs.</li>\n<li>Promote the <a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408884087706-Enabling-customer-callback\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">callback option</a> to customers. Callback requests don't incur costs while customers are waiting, unlike costs that accumulate when callers remain on hold.</li>\n<li>Implement <a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408830696090-Understanding-Talk-Embedded-voice\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">digital lines</a>, such as a call button on your website or mobile app, enabling customers to contact support over the internet rather than through traditional phone lines.</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408836253338\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Analyze the volume and costs</a> of abandoned calls each month and devise strategies to decrease these occurrences.</li>\n<li>Regularly access and export data from your <a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408825620378-Reviewing-your-Talk-usage-charges\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">usage charges</a> for a detailed breakdown of your charges. Input the dates from your Talk invoice and obtain specific usage information. Export the report to CSV for an in-depth analysis. You will be able to identify the most expensive calls and evaluate whether your current setup is cost-effective.</li>\n<li>Redirect calls to self-service options like a knowledge base, <a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4598810401562-How-can-I-send-an-automatic-text-when-customers-call-in\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">SMS or messaging</a> and other self-service channels. Reserve voice calls to handle complex customer issues.</li>\n<li>If you already are a Zendesk customer, use the <a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408846483482-Zendesk-Talk-number-availability-and-pricing#h_b03191e2-5c41-40f5-81bb-9752cb9de841\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">package discounts on Talk credit</a>. This package allows you to save up to 20% on your invoice. You will receive additional credits, for the same amount of money you would typically spend.</li>\n</ul>"
