Can I delete the channel and re-add it as an Exchange\n                connector?</strong></p>\n<p class=\"p\">To switch from email forwarding to the Exchange connector, you must first remove all\n                previous connections and configurations associated with the email address you wish\n                to configure in the Exchange connector.

Ending a session releases their messaging capacity, freeing them up to receive another messaging ticket. However, omnichannel routing couldn't route the tickets associated with agent-ended messaging sessions.<br><br>This release adds a setting, named <em>Route all agent-ended messaging sessions as email</em>, to the <a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4828787357210#topic_hr4_1lh_n2c\">omnichannel routing configuration</a>. This setting makes it possible for omnichannel routing to route tickets associated with agent-ended messaging sessions by treating them as email tickets. By default, these tickets are assigned to the agent who ended the messaging session and are then counted toward the agent's email capacity. However, if the agent reassigns the ticket to a group, assuming the ticket has the auto-routing tag, it is then re-routed as if it were an email ticket. </p>\n<p>When the <em>Route all agent-ended messaging sessions as email</em> option is selected in your omnichannel routing configuration, the ticket's channel (via type) remains unchanged and it still appear as messaging tickets in the Agent Workspace. Any correspondence after the messaging session is ended occurs over email. The only indicator that this setting has been applied to a ticket is in the <a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408829602970\">ticket's event history</a>.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/8997277895194\" width=\"624\" height=\"196\"></p>\n<p>In addition to the new setting, there's also a <a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/6716530152858#topic_amf_zjd_42c\">new queue condition</a> for the routing channel, which makes it possible to define queues specifically based on how they're being treated by omnichannel routing, such as  agent-ended messaging sessions being treated as email tickets.</p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01GD3S9GD63FPDGQSEFY88M3ND\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Why is Zendesk making this change?</span></h2>\n<p>The features in this release work together with the end messaging session option, to provide a seamless follow-up process for live conversations that move from messaging to email. Together these settings can improve your average handling time, agent efficiency, and the overall experience for your agents and end users alike.</p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01GD3S9TSPXM7M4WHYKYF4E84M\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What do I need to do?</span></h2>\n<p>This feature is being rolled out to all accounts with omnichannel routing. To start using it, you must <a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/8983346669722\">allow agents to end messaging sessions</a> and then <a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4828787357210#topic_hr4_1lh_n2c\">update your omnichannel routing configuration</a> to select <em>Route all agent-ended messaging sessions as email</em>. Optionally, you can also <a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/6716530152858\">create or update omnichannel routing queues</a> to use the <em>Routing channel</em> condition.</p>\n<p>If you have feedback or questions related to this announcement, visit our <a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/community/topics\">community forum</a> where we collect and manage customer product feedback.

This is ideal\n            for Microsoft customers looking to connect their online Microsoft 365 or Exchange\n            servers and leverage their Exchange and Outlook workflows.</p>\n<p class=\"p\">The main advantage of this solution is that it allows you to send and receive email\n            traffic to and from your customers using your domain’s email services, while ensuring\n            encrypted and secure relays to and from Zendesk.</p>\n<p class=\"p\">Microsoft Exchange is the server powering all Microsoft email products, including\n            Microsoft 365.

They were unable to open the dropdown, and the options were not being populated correctly.</p>\n<p class=\"undefined\"> </p>\n<h3 id=\"h_01JNPNF9YQ6002EANN2N386EEW\" class=\"p1\"><strong>TIMELINE</strong></h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>February 28, 2025 05:52 PM UTC | February 28, 2025 09:52 AM PT </strong><br>We have confirmed a recent update which caused the issues with the \"Type\" dropdown field, and have rolled back that update. After reloading your browser, please let us know if you continue to experience any issues.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>February 28, 2025 05:48 PM UTC | February 28, 2025 09:48 AM PT </strong><br>We have confirmed an issue affecting the \"Type\" dropdown field, causing the dropdown options to not show up.

Specifically, when an account that had previously supported ticket forms was downgraded to a plan without this feature, the system failed to properly sync the backend queries, resulting in incomplete data being presented in the UI. This inconsistency led to the Type dropdown not populating correctly for affected customers.</p>\n<h4 id=\"h_01JNPNG0C5496JF0BP4DVZXPWW\"><span style=\"color: #666666;\"><br>Resolution</span></h4>\n<p>To resolve this issue, the on-call team rolled back the deployment to the previous stable version, effectively reverting the changes that caused the incident. This action restored normal functionality to the Type dropdown and addressed the related issues with the Due Date field.</p>\n<h4 id=\"h_01JNPNG0C5V7Y5PQTSQSHQSKRX\"><span style=\"color: #666666;\"><br>Remediation Items</span></h4>\n<ol>\n<li>Implement a check in the UI to bypass form responses when the account does not have the ticket-forms feature, ensuring all active ticket fields are loaded correctly.</li>\n<li>Modify the backend to associate all ticket fields with the default form when no forms are available in an account, preventing incomplete data from being presented in the UI.</li>\n<li>Increase test coverage for smoke tests to include scenarios where accounts are downgraded, ensuring that similar issues can be identified before deployment.</li>\n<li>Create additional alerts for monitoring changes to the Type and Priority fields to quickly detect any future discrepancies.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>By addressing these remediation items, we aim to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future and enhance the overall stability of our ticketing system.</p>\n<h4> </h4>\n<h4 id=\"h_01JNPN581KWN6HYYEHF7VT3S18\"><strong>FOR MORE INFORMATION</strong></h4>\n<p class=\"p1\">For current system status information about Zendesk and specific impacts to your account, visit our <a href=\"https://status.zendesk.com\">system status page</a>.

This URL is then used in the Environments section of the integration builder to make the POST request.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Navigate to the Environments section of the integration builder.</li>\n<li>For Method type, select POST.</li>\n<li>Add your constructed URL endpoint for the Ticket API.<br><img src=\"https://zen-marketing-documentation.s3.amazonaws.com/docs/en/aiaa_create_ticket_1.png\" width=\"600\">\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"h_01JMMFQ43657G51D38ZNH6M41F\">Auth</h2>\n<p>To access the Zendesk API, you will need to create a token in Admin Center.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>In Admin center, go to Apps and integrations and select APIs &gt; Zendesk API.<br>You will see the below screen where you can add a new token.<br><img src=\"https://zen-marketing-documentation.s3.amazonaws.com/docs/en/aiaa_create_ticket_2.png\" width=\"600\">\n</li>\n<li>Click <strong>Add API token</strong>.</li>\n<li>Give it a name such as <strong>Create Ticket</strong>.</li>\n<li>Copy the token somewhere safe, as you will need this for setting up the integration in the integration builder.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Once you have these, you can add them to your integration in the integration builder.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>In the <strong>Environment</strong> section, click <strong>Authorization</strong>.</li>\n<li>In <strong>Authorization</strong> type, select <strong>Basic Auth</strong>.</li>\n<li>Enter an admin email address with <strong>/token</strong> appended at the end.</li>\n<li>Paste your created token as the password.<br><img src=\"https://zen-marketing-documentation.s3.amazonaws.com/docs/en/aiaa_create_ticket_3.png\" width=\"600\">\n</li>\n<li>Make sure to include the authorization token in the request by manually constructing it in the headers.<br><img src=\"https://zen-marketing-documentation.s3.amazonaws.com/docs/en/aiaa_create_ticket_4.png\" width=\"600\">\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"h_01JMMFQBCBH3ES3XV31PB31320\">Request Parameters</h2>\n<p>This is where you will be passing data from the AI agent conversation into the integration to create the ticket.</p>\n<p>For the live integration, you will need to set the parameters on your dialogue and then match these to your request parameters in the integration builder. For testing purposes, you can create the request parameters with test values as we are not using live data from a conversation.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://zen-marketing-documentation.s3.amazonaws.com/docs/en/aiaa_create_ticket_5.png\" width=\"600\"></p>\n<p>Make sure that your request parameter names match those that you have set in your dialogue (via actions). See <a href=\"#h_01JMMFR1R5VAT44D7PFWQZX68X\">Building in the dialogue builder</a> for more information.</p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01JMMFQHBNWZ94J5M8R8XF4TEG\">Body</h2>\n<p>The body is where you are going to send all of the data from the conversation to create the ticket via the Ticket API. The structure of this body must match the schema for the Ticket API.</p>\n<p>To see the schema and which fields can be created with your ticket, see the Zendesk developer documentation <a href=\"https://developer.zendesk.com/api-reference/ticketing/tickets/tickets/#json-format\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>Below is an example request body with the request parameters we created earlier.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://zen-marketing-documentation.s3.amazonaws.com/docs/en/aiaa_create_ticket_6.png\" width=\"600\"></p>\n<p>Test the integration by clicking <strong>Test Production</strong>.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://zen-marketing-documentation.s3.amazonaws.com/docs/en/aiaa_create_ticket_7.png\" width=\"600\"></p>\n<p>You should then be able to see your newly created ticket in your Zendesk dashboard.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://zen-marketing-documentation.s3.amazonaws.com/docs/en/aiaa_create_ticket_8.png\" width=\"600\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01JMMFQQN277KPJZMT0ETWJ2MK\">Chat transcript formatting: Standard vs HTML body</h2>\n<p>The Ticket API supports either <em>body</em> or <em>html_body</em> for comments. When using <em>body</em>, multiple consecutive spaces are collapsed into a single space and multiple new line (“/n”) characters are collapsed into a single new line. Whereas, when using <em>html_body</em>, you're able to use standard HTML syntax for your comment formatting.</p>\n<p>For more information, see the Zendesk developer documentation <a href=\"https://developer.zendesk.com/api-reference/ticketing/tickets/ticket_comments/#bodies\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>To use either in your created ticket, you'll structure the one you want to use in “comment” in the request body.</p>\n<p>Note: Use either option, not both as in the demonstration below.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://zen-marketing-documentation.s3.amazonaws.com/docs/en/aiaa_create_ticket_9.png\" width=\"600\"></p>\n<p>If you're sending the chat transcript from the conversation, then it's recommended that you use the reformat values tool to make the transcript more readable. Rather than just being one big chunk of text, you can add line breaks for the beginning of each message. </p>\n<p>If you're sending an HTML body, then you can use the Reformat values tool to add your HTML.</p>\n<p>For instructions on how to use the Reformat values tool, see <a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/8560203369242\">Reformatting values in request parameters for advanced AI agents</a>.</p>\n<p>In the screenshot below, we've reformatted the chat transcript to make clickable URLs and added line breaks with <em>&lt;br&gt;</em>.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://zen-marketing-documentation.s3.amazonaws.com/docs/en/aiaa_create_ticket_10.png\" width=\"600\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01JMMGVKJ5KYYBZKRXYF3ZWGXY\">Standard fields vs Custom field values</h2>\n<p>In addition to the standard fields that can be created and sent in the body of the request, you can also create custom field values. For instructions on how to set up custom fields in the body, see the Zendesk developer documentation <a href=\"https://developer.zendesk.com/documentation/ticketing/managing-tickets/creating-and-updating-tickets/#setting-custom-field-values\">here</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01JMMFR1R5VAT44D7PFWQZX68X\">Building in the Dialogue Builder</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Add the API Node and select the Create Zendesk Ticket integration that you created above.</li>\n<li>Create an <a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/8357756651290\">action</a> on the API node which sets the parameters from the conversation.<br>It will look something like this:<br><img src=\"https://zen-marketing-documentation.s3.amazonaws.com/docs/en/aiaa_create_ticket_11.png\" width=\"600\">\n</li>\n<li>Add a message for the Success and Fallback scenarios.<br><img src=\"https://zen-marketing-documentation.s3.amazonaws.com/docs/en/aiaa_create_ticket_12.png\" width=\"600\">\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>\n<script id=\"article-banners-script\">\n    //<![CDATA[\n    const style = document.createElement('style');\n    style.innerHTML = `#styled-article-body{padding:1rem 0 0}#article-body #docs-wmp-link{text-align:right;font-size:.8em}#article-body .article-banners{margin-bottom:1rem}#article-body .article-banner{border:1px solid #ded7ca;background-color:#f6f0e6;margin:0 0 3px;line-height:1}#article-body .article-banner table{border-collapse:collapse;border:none;margin:0;width:auto}#article-body .article-banner td{padding:8px 6px 8px;border:none;font-size:.85em}#article-body .article-banner td:nth-child(2){border-left:1px solid #d0c9bd}#article-body .article-banner strong{font-weight:400;text-shadow:0 0 1px rgba(0,0,0,.5);letter-spacing:.5px}@media (min-width:1600px){#article-body .article-banner td{font-size:.8em}#article-body .docs-wmp-link{font-size:.7em}}`;\n    document.head.appendChild(style);\n    //]]>\n  </script>\n</p>",
