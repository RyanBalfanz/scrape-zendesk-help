This was powerful because it provided a way to filter custom object records to only those associated with those fields, such as only being able to select the ticket requester's orders.</p><p>However, Zendesk contains a lot of data across many objects and fields that can provide just as much usefulness in filtering. Therefore, you can now build filter data availability in all lookup relationship fields, across all objects.</p><p>Additionally, two new operators are now supported for filtering lookup relationship field values: <em>matches</em> and <em>does not match</em>. This makes it possible to include or exclude records based on any field's value. For example, if a ticket has a dropdown field named <em>Product category</em> and a lookup field named <em>Product</em>, it is possible to configure the <em>Product</em> field to only allow the selection of products that match the value in the ticket's <em>Product category</em> field. This sort of filtering on lookup relationship fields can significantly improve the agent and end-user experiences because it displays only relevant options, therein reducing errors and increasing efficiency.</p><figure style=\"width: 100%;\" class=\"wysiwyg-image wysiwyg-image-resized\"><img style=\"aspect-ratio: 1422/720;\" src=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/9637566093082\" width=\"1422\" height=\"720\"></figure><div class=\"p\"><div class=\"note\">\n<span class=\"notetitle\">Note:</span> Any existing filters on lookup relationship fields that use the <em>is</em> operator to compare field values to the Requester, Assignee, Organization, or Current user fields will be automatically converted to use the <em>matches</em> operator. They will continue to operate as expected.</div></div><h2 id=\"h_01GD3S9GD63FPDGQSEFY88M3ND\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Why is Zendesk making this change?</span></h2><p>Zendesk received very positive responses to being able to filter ticket lookup relationship fields based on standard ticket fields, which lead to numerous requests for the same functionality for their custom data. Extending support for dynamic filtering to all objects and custom fields as well as adding the new operators means admins can create rich, multi-tiered catalogs and forms throughout Zendesk without needing to write any code.</p><h2 id=\"h_01GD3S9TSPXM7M4WHYKYF4E84M\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What do I need to do?</span></h2><p>This functionality is available to all accounts.

These issues impacted all Pods but primarily Pod 17 and 20 were impacted.<br><br><strong>TIMELINE</strong></p><p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-justify\"><strong>August 8, 2025 12:44 AM UTC | August 7, 2025 05:44 PM PT</strong></p><p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-justify\">We are pleased to inform you that the issue affecting Support has been resolved. Thank you for your patience and cooperation throughout this process.</p><p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-justify\"><strong>August 8, 2025 12:01 AM UTC | August 7, 2025 05:01 PM PT</strong></p><p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-justify\">We are aware of an issue affecting Support, where customers are experiencing workflow disruptions related to delays in background job processing, including failed bulk updates and the inability to merge tickets. Our engineering team is actively addressing the problem, and we are beginning to observe performance improvements. We will continue to provide updates as we investigate further. Thank you for your patience and understanding.</p><p> </p><p><strong>POST-MORTEM</strong></p><h4 id=\"h_01K2MR43MZ58HW1BN8BNKRFK4C\">Root-Cause Analysis</h4><p>A recent change to how we handle background tasks (jobs that run behind the scenes to keep your workflows moving) had overly restrictive job scheduling. When a small number of accounts performed very large operations, our system became overloaded and could not keep up. This led to a backlog of tasks, which meant that some customer actions took much longer than usual or failed altogether.</p><h4 id=\"h_01K2MR5R5FYK49K6WF3RZV4KF6\">Resolution</h4><p>As soon as we discovered the problem, our engineering teams:</p><ul>\n<li>Stopped the new background job process in the most affected areas, then across the whole platform, to prevent the issue from getting worse.</li>\n<li>Cleared out the backlog of stuck jobs so that normal processing could resume.</li>\n<li>Closely monitored system health to make sure all customer workflows were restored.</li>\n</ul><h4 id=\"h_01K2MR7J5K1TGDKM7JNM89ABBA\">Remediation Items</h4><p>We are taking several steps to prevent this from happening again:</p><ul>\n<li>Adding new limits and safeguards to stop any single account from overloading the system.</li>\n<li>Improving how we manage and prioritize background tasks, especially during busy times.</li>\n<li>Updating our monitoring so we can spot and fix similar issues  faster.</li>\n</ul><p> </p><p><strong>FOR MORE INFORMATION</strong></p><p><span style=\"background-color: #fefaf2; color: #16140c;\">For current system status information about Zendesk and specific impacts to your account, visit our </span><a href=\"https://status.zendesk.com/\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\">system status page</span></a><span style=\"background-color: #fefaf2; color: #16140c;\">.

This new support process and direct process ensures that developers receive timely help tailored specifically to their integration needs.</p><p>Types of issues handled by Marketplace Partner Developer Support:</p><ul>\n<li>Problems or questions related to your integrations listed in the Marketplace</li>\n<li>Issues or bugs with Zendesk products that impact your integrations</li>\n</ul><h3 id=\"h_01K22M45AR49ACNHVJ6SC21VEZ\">How is this different from Marketplace Operations?</h3><p>Marketplace Operations oversees the daily management of the App Marketplace and Marketplace portal. This includes tasks such as publishing and updating apps, themes, bots, and managing public listings and Stripe pricing plane, and coordinating communications with partner developers. Their scope covers: </p><ul>\n<li>App submissions and update processes to the Zendesk Marketplace</li>\n<li>Handling requests related to Global OAuth client creation or modifications</li>\n<li>Managing sponsored account inquiries</li>\n<li>Addressing questions about app listing metrics and performances</li>\n<li>Managing access to the Marketplace portal (apps.zendesk.com)</li>\n</ul><p>Marketplace Operations does <em>not</em> provide troubleshooting or support pertaining to the Zendesk App Framework (ZAF) or API issues.</p><h2 id=\"h_01JWRW560TC1GFNVJNXPQSJ9XD\">What do I need to do?</h2><p>No action is required to benefit from this new support process.</p><p>If you have feedback or questions related to this announcement, visit our <a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/community/topics\">community forum</a> where we collect and manage customer product feedback.

How do AI agents weigh which articles are the most relevant or important?</p><h2 id=\"h_01HYBAYSYEBM197897FQ8P2KW9\">Answer</h2><p>You can use the <a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408835056154-Using-labels-on-your-help-center-articles\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">labels</a> to specify articles that should be used in autoreplies. For example, if there is an article that AI agents should consider and suggest, you can add the label <code>use_for_autoreply</code> to that article. You can also create differentiated labels based on the type of user, such as <code>iOS</code> and <code>Android</code> to articles with content specific to different platform segments.</p><p>It is important to create concise, focused content and to simplify your content wherever possible. For AI functions, it is better to have several short articles that each answer one question rather than fewer broad articles. Titles, labels, and article content all play a role in how AI surfaces and suggests an article. For more information, see the article: <a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408882682010-Best-practices-Optimizing-for-autoreplies-with-articles\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Best practices: Optimizing for autoreplies with articles</a></p><p>Keep your labels short and concise. Labels help surface articles in searches and improve AI recommendations, and the title of the article and first 45 words of the article body are weighted more heavily than labels. If articles are not appearing in suggestions as expected, first optimize your article titles and content, then review your labels.

This is a natural result of how data flows through modern distributed systems, and how Zendesk WFM processes events in micro‑batches to balance speed and reliability.</p><ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Why it happens</strong>: To ensure high availability and consistency, Zendesk WFM groups rapid status changes into small data windows before it presents them in the UI. This approach prevents dropped events during network blips or momentary high load.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>What you see</strong>: A fraction‑of‑a‑second delay in status updates, typically less than 2 to 3 seconds, during periods of exceptionally rapid activity or transient connectivity fluctuations.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Why you can trust it</strong>: Even during these brief windows, Zendesk WFM records every single event.</li>\n</ul><p>For more information, see this article: <a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/6443347506970-About-the-Agent-activity-page\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">About the Agent activity page</a>.</p>",
