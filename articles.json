      "body": "<p>We’re thrilled to announce that WhatsApp Flows are officially supported by the <a href=\"https://developer.zendesk.com/api-reference/conversations/\">Sunshine Conversations API</a>. With Flows, you can create bespoke conversational experiences that are native to WhatsApp, whether its for triaging tickets, collecting new leads, or providing tailored product recommendations -- you can do it all with Flows.</p><h3 id=\"h_01K36GH5GWS6D5CSMSM8RE9Y27\">What are WhatsApp Flows?</h3><p>WhatsApp Flows are a type of WhatsApp Message Template that are highly interactive. They enable your business to send rich, multi-step, templated messages for collecting data. </p><h3 id=\"h_01K36J7MMSYHMW6QTXE39XCTM4\">What do I need to do?</h3><p>Because support for Flows is being released as an API-first feature, you'll need access to the <a href=\"https://developer.zendesk.com/api-reference/conversations/\">Sunshine Conversations API</a> and have your own webhook URL configured to receive the events containing the Flow response. Access to the Messaging platform is available to customers on the Suite Professional or Enterprise plans.</p><h3 id=\"h_01K375VWGMS6XFT3ZG727BAM6Q\">What are the pricing implications?</h3><p>The use of Flows as described below will count toward your MAUs and may also count towards your Notification API usage, depending on how the Flows are sent. Both of these <a href=\"https://www.zendesk.com/pricing/\">platform usage fees</a> are billed through Zendesk. Additionally, <a href=\"https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/pricing\">WhatsApp Message Template fees</a> apply for the use of Flows. For most customers, Zendesk will pass-through the charges to our customers on behalf of WhatsApp. </p><h3 id=\"h_01K36GH5GWBJAMTY35XRCWSTRK\">How does it work?</h3><ol>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/flows/gettingstarted/\">Create your desired Flow</a> through your WhatsApp Business Account under the Message template section.</li>\n<li>Once your new Flow is approved by Meta, you can send it programmatically to your customers via our <a href=\"https://developer.zendesk.com/documentation/conversations/messaging-platform/programmable-conversations/outbound-messaging/#using-the-notification-api-on-whatsapp\">Notification API</a> or <a href=\"https://developer.zendesk.com/documentation/conversations/messaging-platform/programmable-conversations/message-overrides/#flow-template-messages\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-stringify-link=\"https://developer.zendesk.com/documentation/conversations/messaging-platform/programmable-conversations/message-overrides/#flow-template-messages\" data-sk=\"tooltip_parent\">Sending Flows Using Override</a> option, depending on if the customer already has an open conversation with the business or not.</li>\n<li>Once your customer completes the Flow, their responses are sent back to you through Sunshine Conversations via a <code data-stringify-type=\"code\">passthrough:messaging</code> webhook event. You can then use this webhook to automate the next steps in the conversation based on their answers.<ul>\n<li>Please make sure that you <a href=\"https://developer.zendesk.com/documentation/conversations/messaging-platform/programmable-conversations/receiving-messages/#passthrough-webhooks\">update your webhooks</a> to start listening for this new event.</li>\n<li>The <code>response_json</code> section of the event is where you'll find your customer's replies to the questions in your Flow.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol><h3 id=\"h_01K36J1DPN8TQWM4M74AYCDQYV\">What's next</h3><p>We'll be working on making Flows available out-of-the-box for customers who would like to use them with their AI agents (Advanced or Essential). Additionally, we plan to add support for agents to be able to manually trigger and receive Flow responses directly in the conversation view.</p><p>If you have feedback or questions related to this announcement, visit our <a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/community/topics/1260801308710\">community forum</a> where we collect and manage customer product feedback.

The new\n                        article editor uses more structured HTML to generate a cleaner and more\n                        predictable output, and therefore does not always support the custom HTML\n                        code that may exist in your legacy articles. </p>\n<p class=\"p\">If a legacy article contains custom HTML that is unsupported in the new editor,\n                        the article content is wrapped in an HTML block. Wrapping custom HTML in an\n                        HTML block helps the new editor recognize and render your code correctly.\n                        Without this, the new article editor may misinterpret your HTML, leading to\n                        layout problems or unexpected formatting during publishing. </p>\n<p class=\"p\">The following image illustrates what you'll see if you open an affected article\n                        in the new article editor. Note that while the content is wrapped in an HTML\n                        block, you're still able to preview and publish the original article.</p>\n<p class=\"p\"><img class=\"image\" id=\"topic_dsx_rkb_jgc__image_xg1_1md_hgc\" src=\"https://zen-marketing-documentation.s3.amazonaws.com/docs/en/guide-htmlblock-newart-ed.png\" width=\"450\"></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div aria-labelledby=\"ariaid-title3\" class=\"topic nested1\" id=\"topic_h2k_ykb_jgc\">\n<h2 class=\"title topictitle2\" id=\"ariaid-title3\">Fixing HTML block issues in the new article editor</h2>\n<div class=\"body\">\n<div class=\"p\">For the long term, it's recommended that you update your article code to remove\n                        unsupported or custom HTML to be compatible with the new article editor.\n                        However, since this can take time to do, you can use any of the following\n                        strategies to edit and publish your articles until you're ready to upgrade\n                        them: <ul class=\"ul\" id=\"topic_h2k_ykb_jgc__ul_dnj_xdd_hgc\">\n<li class=\"li\"><a class=\"xref\" href=\"#topic_f1t_pjq_hgc\">Leave the article as-is and continue to publish in the new article editor</a></li>\n<li class=\"li\"><a class=\"xref\" href=\"#topic_i2p_zjq_hgc\">Revert the article to the legacy editor</a></li>\n<li class=\"li\"><a class=\"xref\" href=\"#topic_hld_vlq_hgc\">Edit the source code in the HTML block</a></li>\n<li class=\"li\"><a class=\"xref\" href=\"#topic_nkt_tgd_hgc\">Unlink the HTML block and fix the underlying compatibility issue</a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div aria-labelledby=\"ariaid-title4\" class=\"topic nested2\" id=\"topic_f1t_pjq_hgc\">\n<h3 class=\"title topictitle3\" id=\"ariaid-title4\">Leave the article as-is and continue to publish in the new article editor</h3>\n<div class=\"body\">\n<div class=\"p\">\n<strong class=\"ph b\">When to use</strong>: This solution is appropriate if: <ul class=\"ul\" id=\"topic_f1t_pjq_hgc__ul_bks_14q_hgc\">\n<li class=\"li\">Your article content is stable and you don't anticipate\n                                          having to make any edits or additions to the content.</li>\n<li class=\"li\">You use an API to create articles and only use the new\n                                          article editor to preview and publish.</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<p class=\"p\"><strong class=\"ph b\">Description</strong>: You can leave the article in the HTML block and\n                              continue publishing in the new article editor.

These issues impacted all Pods but primarily Pod 17 and 20 were impacted.<br><br><strong>TIMELINE</strong></p><p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-justify\"><strong>August 8, 2025 12:44 AM UTC | August 7, 2025 05:44 PM PT</strong></p><p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-justify\">We are pleased to inform you that the issue affecting Support has been resolved. Thank you for your patience and cooperation throughout this process.</p><p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-justify\"><strong>August 8, 2025 12:01 AM UTC | August 7, 2025 05:01 PM PT</strong></p><p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-justify\">We are aware of an issue affecting Support, where customers are experiencing workflow disruptions related to delays in background job processing, including failed bulk updates and the inability to merge tickets. Our engineering team is actively addressing the problem, and we are beginning to observe performance improvements. We will continue to provide updates as we investigate further. Thank you for your patience and understanding.</p><p> </p><p><strong>POST-MORTEM</strong></p><h4 id=\"h_01K2MR43MZ58HW1BN8BNKRFK4C\">Root-Cause Analysis</h4><p>A recent change to how we handle background tasks (jobs that run behind the scenes to keep your workflows moving) had overly restrictive job scheduling. When a small number of accounts performed very large operations, our system became overloaded and could not keep up. This led to a backlog of tasks, which meant that some customer actions took much longer than usual or failed altogether.</p><h4 id=\"h_01K2MR5R5FYK49K6WF3RZV4KF6\">Resolution</h4><p>As soon as we discovered the problem, our engineering teams:</p><ul>\n<li>Stopped the new background job process in the most affected areas, then across the whole platform, to prevent the issue from getting worse.</li>\n<li>Cleared out the backlog of stuck jobs so that normal processing could resume.</li>\n<li>Closely monitored system health to make sure all customer workflows were restored.</li>\n</ul><h4 id=\"h_01K2MR7J5K1TGDKM7JNM89ABBA\">Remediation Items</h4><p>We are taking several steps to prevent this from happening again:</p><ul>\n<li>Adding new limits and safeguards to stop any single account from overloading the system.</li>\n<li>Improving how we manage and prioritize background tasks, especially during busy times.</li>\n<li>Updating our monitoring so we can spot and fix similar issues  faster.</li>\n</ul><p> </p><p><strong>FOR MORE INFORMATION</strong></p><p><span style=\"background-color: #fefaf2; color: #16140c;\">For current system status information about Zendesk and specific impacts to your account, visit our </span><a href=\"https://status.zendesk.com/\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\">system status page</span></a><span style=\"background-color: #fefaf2; color: #16140c;\">.

How do AI agents weigh which articles are the most relevant or important?</p><h2 id=\"h_01HYBAYSYEBM197897FQ8P2KW9\">Answer</h2><p>You can use the <a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408835056154-Using-labels-on-your-help-center-articles\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">labels</a> to specify articles that should be used in autoreplies. For example, if there is an article that AI agents should consider and suggest, you can add the label <code>use_for_autoreply</code> to that article. You can also create differentiated labels based on the type of user, such as <code>iOS</code> and <code>Android</code> to articles with content specific to different platform segments.</p><p>It is important to create concise, focused content and to simplify your content wherever possible. For AI functions, it is better to have several short articles that each answer one question rather than fewer broad articles. Titles, labels, and article content all play a role in how AI surfaces and suggests an article. For more information, see the article: <a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408882682010-Best-practices-Optimizing-for-autoreplies-with-articles\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Best practices: Optimizing for autoreplies with articles</a></p><p>Keep your labels short and concise. Labels help surface articles in searches and improve AI recommendations, and the title of the article and first 45 words of the article body are weighted more heavily than labels. If articles are not appearing in suggestions as expected, first optimize your article titles and content, then review your labels.

When this feature is disabled, the Web Widget (Classic) cannot be used to submit a ticket.

Ensure the requester is not using a support address.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Active messaging conversations</p>\n<p>Redaction is not allowed in active messaging conversations.

This is a natural result of how data flows through modern distributed systems, and how Zendesk WFM processes events in micro‑batches to balance speed and reliability.</p><ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Why it happens</strong>: To ensure high availability and consistency, Zendesk WFM groups rapid status changes into small data windows before it presents them in the UI. This approach prevents dropped events during network blips or momentary high load.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>What you see</strong>: A fraction‑of‑a‑second delay in status updates, typically less than 2 to 3 seconds, during periods of exceptionally rapid activity or transient connectivity fluctuations.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Why you can trust it</strong>: Even during these brief windows, Zendesk WFM records every single event.</li>\n</ul><p>For more information, see this article: <a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/6443347506970-About-the-Agent-activity-page\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">About the Agent activity page</a>.</p>",

Below is an overview of how you can use Zendesk products to provide the necessary notices and obtain consent from your end-users:</p><h3 id=\"h_01K19G6WDD395P9DQJPE6D1QNQ\">1. Call Recording Permissions: Opt-In and Opt-Out Notices</h3><p>If your business records calls, you may be required to inform callers or obtain their consent depending on applicable laws. Zendesk provides options for call recordings, allowing you to comply with opt-in or opt-out requirements.</p><p><em>Learn more:</em><a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408838605210-Understanding-call-recording-permissions-opt-in-and-opt-out\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\">Understanding call recording permissions (opt-in and opt-out)</span></a>.</p><h3 id=\"h_01K19G6WDFZ7QH3743ZCFN02NR\">2. Legal Notices in Web-Based Widgets and Pre-Chat Form</h3><p><strong>Web-based Widgets: </strong>When engaging with customers via Zendesk’s web-based messaging widgets, you can link to your privacy notice directly within the widget interface. You can also configure other notice options, such as configuring default greeting messages or providing notice through the use of a cookie banner. </p><p><strong>Pre-chat Form Using Web Tools in Zendesk Chat:</strong> You can create a custom pre-chat form using web tools in Zendesk Chat. This pre-chat form can include a checkbox for end-users. You can use the SDK to rebuild the entire widget, add additional disclaimers, and leverage the translations available in multiple languages. When the user submits the form, the account can initiate chat using the zChat.init API. You can add tags to store the consent along with the chat. These tags are available with the chats and can be downloaded by the account in CSV format. Admins can identify the chats and delete the chats where end-users do not wish to have their details stored with the account. Tags can help identify such chats. You can also create a similar notice for your offline forms. Please note that this feature is specific to Zendesk Chat and does not apply to Zendesk Messaging. </p><p><em>Learn more: </em><a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/5018479936922-Notifying-end-users-of-legal-terms-in-Zendesk-s-web-based-widgets\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\">Notifying end users of legal terms in Zendesk’s web-based widgets,</span></a><em> </em><a href=\"https://api.zopim.com/web-sdk/#zchat-init-options\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\">zChat.init API (options)</span></a> and <a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/sections/4405298916890-Setting-up-Zendesk-Chat\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\">Setting up Zendesk Chat</span></a>.</p><h3 id=\"h_01K19G6WDJCCWBEG1VR1D4B4NG\">3.
