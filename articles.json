Due to this disruption, attachments sent during the incident were not delivered and must be resent by end-users.</p><h3 id=\"h_01KFZG5V29VG1SD4TAXW7WBQY8\"><span style=\"color: #06363c;\"><strong>Timeline</strong></span></h3><p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-justify\"><strong>January 20, 2026 05:10 PM UTC | January 20, 2026 09:10 AM PT</strong></p><p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-justify\">We regret to inform you that attachments which were missed during the impact of this incident are unable to be recovered. At this time WhatsApp functionality is back to normal following our fix. Please ask customers to resend attachments if needed.

Due to this problem, the system was unable to retrieve certain media files. The cause was external and unrelated to any changes on our side. Additionally, an internal feature designed to avoid duplicate messages unintentionally prevented the recovery of some missed attachments.</p><h3 id=\"h_01KFZG4TEK3S0H624XCEE8ZJYX\"><span style=\"color: #06363c;\"><strong>Resolution</strong></span></h3><p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-justify\">To fix this issue, we implemented a fix that used an alternative method to retrieve media files, bypassing the affected service. This restored the delivery of new attachments. Unfortunately, attempts to recover attachments that failed during the incident were unsuccessful. Customers have been informed that any missed attachments will need to be resent.</p><h3 id=\"h_01KFZG4TEMNG7MPDTQNV8HRSBY\"><span style=\"color: #06363c;\"><strong>Remediation Items</strong></span></h3><ol>\n<li data-list-item-id=\"eb5f297b8d78e2365f61c4ca710eebd4d\"><p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-justify\">Set up monitoring to specifically track the delivery of media files to quickly identify any future issues.</p></li>\n<li data-list-item-id=\"e139ad06604be0f47a4e1fb58fd4469c6\"><p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-justify\">Review and improve the system that prevents duplicate messages to avoid accidentally blocking valid message retries.</p></li>\n<li data-list-item-id=\"e757ff758adabf7e3ed0a209d2eaedd8e\"><p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-justify\">Consider adding clear notifications for agents when media files cannot be retrieved, to help with awareness and troubleshooting.</p></li>\n</ol>",

How can I do that?</p><h2 id=\"h_01HYBAYSYEBM197897FQ8P2KW9\">Answer</h2><p>When SSO is enabled, your identity provider handles authentication, so verifying extra email addresses is restricted and must be done while SSO is temporarily turned off. If you need to add and verify additional addresses, temporarily disable SSO, add the additional email addresses, complete the verification, then re-enable SSO.</p><p>We strongly recommend coordinating this operation with your IT or Identity provider team to minimize user impact. For more information on managing SSO in your account, see <a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408882188570-Managing-single-sign-on-SSO-configurations\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Managing single sign-on (SSO) configurations</a>.</p>",

Payline enables secure, agent-assisted credit card payments without exposing agents to sensitive data. Agents maintain voice communication with customers while credit card information is captured separately via phone keypad or via voice, keeping agents completely isolated from payment data. The customer enters their card details using their phone keypad or provides them verbally while the agent guides them through the process. Card data is securely captured, encrypted, and transmitted directly to your payment provider—agents never see, hear, or access sensitive information.</div></li></ul>\n</li>\n<li data-list-item-id=\"e4ef4f37691742a5802917c284e13b7c5\">\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://www.zendesk.com/marketplace/apps/support/1196437/resolver-ai/\"> Resolver AI</a> <strong>(Support) (paid)</strong>\n</div>\n<ul><li data-list-item-id=\"ee30656cc023c01b214df42d72cd5b977\"><div>Resolver AI is a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) Zendesk app that helps agents draft accurate, policy-aligned customer responses in seconds—directly inside the ticket. Instead of “guessing,” Resolver AI retrieves the most relevant Zendesk Help Center articles and synced internal documents and uses them (along with the latest customer query and optional agent instructions) to generate a grounded, high-quality draft response. Ideal for reducing handle time, improving consistency, and ensuring every response stays aligned with approved support content.</div></li></ul>\n</li>\n<li data-list-item-id=\"e02fa29f890e86792039ec0bb00ab72f1\">\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://www.zendesk.com/marketplace/apps/support/1199531/automox-itsm/\">Automox ITSM </a><strong>(Support)</strong>\n</div>\n<ul><li data-list-item-id=\"e7c66a59f80524e4d4bc467f12ff2df1d\"><div>Automox ITSM brings the power of Automox endpoint management directly into your Zendesk workflow.

To maintain secure authentication flows, developers must update their apps to use more secure authentication methods such as OAuth 2.0. Where OAuth 2.0 isn't supported, you can use basic authentication with a <a href=\"https://developer.zendesk.com/documentation/apps/app-developer-guide/making-api-requests-from-a-zendesk-app/#using-secure-settings\">secure setting</a>, which stores the secret securely in the Zendesk infrastructure.</p><h2 id=\"h_01GD3S9GD63FPDGQSEFY88M3ND\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Why is Zendesk making this change?</span></h2><p>This update enhances security by reducing risks related to password collection, storage, and handling. It helps protect sensitive customer information and aligns apps with modern security standards. Using secure settings for third-party credentials reduces attack vectors and strengthens overall data protection.</p><h2 id=\"h_01GD3S9TSPXM7M4WHYKYF4E84M\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What do I need to do?</span></h2><p>Update your app by April 29, 2026, if it collects third-party credentials using a manifest parameter with <code>type: \"password\"</code>. Choose one of the following approaches:</p><ul>\n<li data-list-item-id=\"e8a88ca5c71eb0f5c50179d48cf6aa3a8\">Use <a href=\"https://developer.zendesk.com/documentation/apps/app-developer-guide/making-api-requests-from-a-zendesk-app/#using-a-third-party-oauth-access-token\">OAuth 2.0 authentication</a> (recommended).</li>\n<li data-list-item-id=\"e722dd3b83bad2a4b43a7e8a2b6e23841\">Use <a href=\"https://developer.zendesk.com/documentation/apps/app-developer-guide/making-api-requests-from-a-zendesk-app/#using-basic-access-authentication\">basic authentication</a> with a secure setting to store the secret securely.</li>\n</ul><p>If your app currently uses a secure setting with <code>type: \"password\"</code>, update the setting type to <code>text</code> (while keeping it secure). The existing secret is retained and admins won't need to re-enter it.</p><p>If you have feedback or questions related to this announcement, visit our <a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/community/topics\">community forum</a> where we collect and manage customer product feedback.
