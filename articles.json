      "body": "<h2 id=\"h_01HYBAYSYE6D5MS9R76RP14V1N\">Question</h2>\n<p>Why am I getting a <code>409</code> conflict error when authenticating users via Messaging JWT authentication?</p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01HYBAYSYEBM197897FQ8P2KW9\">Answer</h2>\n<p><code>409</code> errors in messaging JWT authentication indicate that the <code>AppUserID</code> assigned to a specific user <code>external_ID</code> is already being used in the system. Due to this conflict, the current user who tries to log in via JWT authentication can't be authenticated.</p>\n<p>For example, this error can occur when an existing Zendesk user with an external_ID 1234 was updated and the <code>external_ID</code> of the user changed, for example 123456. Both the user in Zendesk and the payload will have the same information, same email, and same external_ID. When trying to authenticate the user however, the email registered for that user will be linked to an <code>AppUserID</code> in Sunshine Conversation. Zendesk will only allow the authentication of the user with the previous external_ID, 1234.</p>\n<p>To resolve this behaviour and allow users with an updated <code>external_ID</code> to log in via JWT authentication, you must delete the previous <code>AppUserID</code> linked to the first <code>external_ID</code>.</p>\n<p>With Suite Professional and above plans, make an API call:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Basic authentication</strong>, use an <a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4576088682266-Using-the-Conversations-API-keys#:~:text=To%20create%20and%20share%20an,Click%20Create%20API%20key.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">API key and a secret key</a>.\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Username</strong>: <code>API_KEY_ID</code>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Password</strong>: <code>API_KEY_SECRET</code>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>API method</strong>: <code>DELETE</code>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>URL for European accounts</strong>: <code>https://api.eu-1.smooch.io/v2/apps/{appId}/users/{userIdOrExternalId}</code>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>URL for the rest of the world</strong>: <code>https://api.smooch.io/v2/apps/{appId}/users/{userIdOrExternalId}</code><br>Within the above URLs, replace the <code>{appId}</code> with the ID provided when generating the API key and secret key, and replace the <code>{userIdOrExternalId}</code> with the previous <code>external_ID</code> linked to the user who returns the error.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"p\">\n<div class=\"note note\">\n<span class=\"notetitle\"><strong>Disclaimer</strong>:</span> This article is provided for instructional purposes only.

This was due to a change in our system that inadvertently caused an error, impacting the availability of these recordings. Once the issue was identified, we reverted the change, restoring normal service.</p>\n<div id=\"message-list\">\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>July 05, 2024 01:52 PM UTC | July 05, 2024 06:52 AM PT </strong><br>Changes were successfully reverted to the previous working state. Logs indicate that our recovery process is functioning and should recover recordings within the next couple of hours. Please allow time for the system to process any previously unavailable recordings. A simple page or browser refresh/update may be required. Thank you for your patience while we worked on this.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>July 05, 2024 01:31 PM UTC | July 05, 2024 06:31 AM PT </strong><br>We are currently aware of and working on reverting recent changes that have impacted Talk customers, causing “Call recordings” to be unavailable across multiple Pods. The next update will be provided in 30 minutes.</p>\n</div>\n<h4 id=\"h_01J2CE2M72E3KBZSRKQ9AN08GW\" class=\"p1\"><strong>POST-MORTEM</strong></h4>\n<p class=\"undefined\"><strong>Root Cause Analysis</strong><br>The issue was caused by a change in our system configuration that affected how call recordings were stored. Specifically, a setting was altered that directed our service to an incorrect storage location, resulting in errors when trying to save call recordings.</p>\n<p><strong>Resolution</strong><br>Upon identifying the issue, we quickly reverted the change that caused the problem. This rollback restored the correct configuration, and our service resumed normal operation.</p>\n<p><strong>Remediation</strong><br>To prevent this from happening again, we are taking the following steps:</p>\n<p>1. Improved Testing: We will enhance our testing processes to catch similar issues before they reach production.<br>2. Configuration Management: We will update our system to use separate settings for different services, ensuring that changes to one service do not inadvertently impact another.<br>3. Monitoring and Alerts: We will improve our monitoring and alerting systems to detect and respond to issues more quickly.</p>\n<h4 id=\"h_01J2CDA4B7BNCA6EZZPHNVQ2D2\"><strong>FOR MORE INFORMATION</strong></h4>\n<p class=\"p1\">For current system status information about your Zendesk, check out our <a href=\"https://status.zendesk.com\">system status page</a>.

Common explanations include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your provider settings: Some providers replace the original caller number with the forwarding number or another default number.</li>\n<li>Possible provider limitations with the caller ID passthrough: When forwarding calls, not all telephony providers support passing through the original caller ID. This is often due to network limitations or policies aimed at preventing spoofing.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To find a solution, reach out to the provider of your forwarding phone number. They can check their policies, settings, and capabilities regarding forwarded calls.</p>\n<p>For more information on Talk, see this article: <a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408827987482-Preparing-to-use-Talk\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Preparing to use Talk</a>.</p>",

Those vulnerabilities are now resolved.</p>\n<p>On Enterprise and Enterprise Plus plans, <a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408882153882\" target=\"_self\">agents in custom roles</a> can now be granted permission to view and manage other team members with the following options: <em>Not Allowed</em>, <em>View only</em>, and <em>Create, assign roles, edit, and delete</em>. These new options enable agents to assign roles to other agents but not themselves. Agents with these permissions also can't manage assignment to admin roles. These permissions are separate from permissions for creating and managing custom roles.</p>\n<p>Additionally, agents can also be granted permission to search and view lists of end users, separately from their permission to access individual end user profiles. With this new permission, agents will be able to search for agents by name, email address, phone number, or organization.</p>\n<p>For more information, see <a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408882153882#topic_tep_mig_bd\" target=\"_self\">Permissions that agents in custom roles can have</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"01H84QADHNPKT0C0MM6YT4TVN9\">Why is Zendesk making this change?</h2>\n<p>We recognize that admins need to delegate some of their responsibilities. Adding and managing team members within their organization is one piece of that. Defining custom roles and managing their permissions is another piece, which we <a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/5500689327514\" target=\"_self\">announced granular permissions for previously</a>. Now agents can be allowed to do all of these aspects of team management without having to be in an admin role.</p>\n<h2 id=\"01H84QADHNHNC2J2F36TGFNFSD\">What do I need to do?</h2>\n<p>Nothing. This is being rolled out to all Enterprise accounts. When you add or edit custom roles, these new permissions will be available for you to set.</p>\n<p>If you have feedback or questions related to this announcement, visit our <a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/community/topics/1260801325369\">community forum</a> where we collect and manage customer product feedback.

Why are some recipients missing?</p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01HYBAYSYEBM197897FQ8P2KW9\">Answer</h2>\n<p>Dashboard delivery is divided into virtual groups when being sent out. These virtual groups are created based on matching locale and timezone settings. If both values do not match, a new virtual group is formed. As a result, if no other recipients share the same settings, you will see the email addressed only to you.</p>\n<p>For example, if a scheduled dashboard is configured to send to the following recipients:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Recipient 1\n<ul>\n<li><span>Email: address1@test.com</span></li>\n<li><span>Language: English US</span></li>\n<li><span>Time zone: GMT+02 Madrid</span></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<span>Recipient 2</span>\n<ul>\n<li><span>Email: address2@test.com</span></li>\n<li><span>Language: Spanish</span></li>\n<li><span>Time zone: GMT+02 Madrid</span></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<span>Recipient 3</span>\n<ul>\n<li><span>Email: address3@test.com</span></li>\n<li><span>Language: Spanish</span></li>\n<li><span>Time zone: GMT+1 London</span></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<span>Recipient 4</span>\n<ul>\n<li><span>Email: address4@test.com</span></li>\n<li><span>Language: English US</span></li>\n<li><span>Time zone: GMT+0 UTC</span></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In the scenario above, the recipients do not have matching locale and timezone settings, so each recipient will see themselves as the only address this scheduled dashboard is being delivered to. Conversely, if multiple recipients have matching locale and time zone settings, the list of recipients will be visible in the<code>TO:</code> field of the email:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/7513071453978\"></p>\n<p>For more information, see this article: <a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408843602714-Scheduling-dashboard-deliveries\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Scheduling dashboard deliveries</a>.</p>",

The most important aspect of the macro will be adding a tag that the automation will use to identify the tickets it needs to run on. This differentiates it from other <strong>Task</strong> tickets in your account where you do not need the automation to run. You can use whatever tag makes sense for your business.

This upgrade is a significant step forward, and we’ve worked diligently to ensure no downtime for our customers using X integrations.</p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01J1TYG2EM5GEBCADQQDV4VXXW\">Why is Zendesk making this change?</h2>\n<p>As part of our continued partnership with X (Twitter), we are upgrading to the X API V2 to ensure there are no outages for our customers with the deprecation of the X (Twitter) V1 API. The X API V2 represents the future of API development for X, focusing on innovation and improved functionality. This upgrade will better serve our customers' needs by providing a more robust and scalable platform for X integrations. We believe these improvements will significantly enhance your experience and productivity when using X integrations.<br>Currently, the X/Twitter API V2 no longer supports the following items:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Typing Indicators in messaging:</strong>  Typing indicators from Zendesk will no longer be visible to end users, which might affect the real-time visibility of customers' typing status in messaging.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Read status in messaging:</strong> The read status indicator, which shows when messages have been read, is no longer supported.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Liking a tweet indicator:</strong> You can still like a comment within a ticket, but the indicator showing this action will not update.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"h_01J1B9QGQHY9ZZ1HNZX68B0M9K\">What do I need to do?</h2>\n<p>Nothing! All changes will be rolled out for all customers using X integrations. Enjoy the increased reliability and support of the X API V2 seamlessly integrated into your Zendesk experience.</p>\n<p>If you have feedback or questions about this announcement, visit our <a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/community/topics\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">community forum,</a> where we diligently collect and manage customer product feedback.
