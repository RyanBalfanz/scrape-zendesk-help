Clearing your cache or using an incognito window should resolve the issue. We will be monitoring errors for the next 24 hours, and if there are no further occurrences, the new incident will be merged into this one. Thank you for your patience and understanding.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>July 16, 2024 04:32 PM UTC | July 16, 2024 09:32 AM PT </strong><br>We've received multiple customer confirmations that clearing cache and cookies has restored access to Zendesk WFM and will be marking this incident as fully resolved.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>July 16, 2024 02:38 PM UTC | July 16, 2024 07:38 AM PT </strong><br>We have observed that the errors on the backend have subsided. We kindly request that you clear your cache and cookies and then confirm whether things are working as expected.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>July 16, 2024 01:59 PM UTC | July 16, 2024 06:59 AM PT </strong><br>In addition to the general platform errors mentioned previously, some customers are also unable to load the WFM widget correctly within Support and the Chrome extension, across multiple Pods.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>July 16, 2024 01:42 PM UTC | July 16, 2024 06:42 AM PT </strong><br>Upon receiving negative confirmation from customers regarding the resolution of the issues, we continue to investigate the problem with Zendesk WFM (formerly Tymeshift). A subset of customers are still seeing the errors “You don’t have access to this feature” and “Something didn’t work / Give it a moment and try again” when trying to access the organization structure. We will provide more information in 1 hour or as soon as we have additional details to share.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>July 16, 2024 01:06 PM UTC | July 16, 2024 06:06 AM PT </strong><br>We are currently seeing improvements in the backend handling of traffic for the impacted accounts, and these accounts should now be able to start loading Zendesk WFM within Zendesk.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>July 16, 2024 12:39 PM UTC | July 16, 2024 05:39 AM PT </strong><br>We are currently investigating reports of slowness or inability to load Zendesk WFM (formerly known as Tymeshift) for some customers across multiple Pods.

However, I've noticed that the number of solved and closed tickets displayed can sometimes differ depending on the user, and it does not match the requester's actual solved tickets. Can you explain why this happens?</p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01HYBAYSYEBM197897FQ8P2KW9\">Answer</h2>\n<p>The difference in the number of solved and closed tickets is due to how the app handles archived tickets based on the number of tickets a user has.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Users with less than 100 tickets: The app excludes archived, solved, and closed tickets from the count. This means that the displayed numbers only reflect tickets that are not archived.</li>\n<li>Users with 100 or more tickets: The app includes archived, solved, and closed tickets in the count. Thus, the numbers shown include all tickets, both active and archived.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The app is designed this way to optimize performance and minimize load on our platform. By excluding archived tickets for users with fewer tickets, the app ensures faster data retrieval and reduces unnecessary processing. For users with a larger volume of tickets, including archived tickets ensures comprehensive data representation without significantly impacting performance.</p>\n<p>For more information about ticket archiving, see the article: <a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408887617050-About-ticket-archiving\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">About ticket archiving</a>.</p>",

Since a single system cannot accommodate all needs, Support apps offer a powerful way to incorporate new use cases and create connected customer experiences.</p>\n<p>For more information on Support top bar apps, see <a href=\"https://developer.zendesk.com/documentation/apps/app-design-guidelines/support/topbar-apps-support/\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\" style=\"color: #1155cc;\">Top bar apps</span></a> in our developer documentation. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/7612166489882\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-07-15 at 12.15.50 PM.png\"></p>\n<p>Visual changes include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The removal of the grayscale border surrounding each top bar app, replaced with a gray fill for a simpler, more consistent style. </li>\n<li>The arrow pointing to the selected top bar app is now positioned at the end of the app container, preventing the container from extending beyond the right side of the app icon.</li>\n<li>A close button has been added to the tooltip modal that appears when a top bar app is selected. This addition enhances accessibility, making the top bar app modal usable for all users, particularly those who rely on keyboard navigation, and aligns with Zendesk’s current target of <a href=\"https://www.zendesk.com/company/agreements-and-terms/accessibility/\">2.1 AA accessibility standards</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/7612763139482\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-07-15 at 2.17.09 PM.png\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01GD3S9GD63FPDGQSEFY88M3ND\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Why is Zendesk making this change?</span></h2>\n<p>As part of Zendesk's broader React Migration Initiative (RMI) to transition the Support frontend to React for enhanced product reliability, improved developer productivity, and easier automated testing, <a href=\"https://developer.zendesk.com/documentation/apps/app-design-guidelines/support/topbar-apps-support/\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\" style=\"color: #1155cc;\">Top bar apps</span></a> in support have now been migrated from Ember to React. This migration aligns with our goal of achieving One Zendesk, standardizing our approach to building features - whether in terms of database storage, API methodology, or in this case, our Javascript framework.</p>\n<p>Currently, half of Zendesk uses Ember, while the other half uses React. React offers numerous advantages:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Developers are more productive and can address issues and develop new features more quickly because we primarily hire React developers, and the language is inherently more composable.</li>\n<li>Migrating entirely to React enhances reliability and stability because:\n<ul>\n<li>Communication between Ember and React is more error-prone.</li>\n<li>It allows us to write automated tests much more efficiently.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"01J2M7Z6ZYK7SHY9P4JFE137G3\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What do I need to do?</span></h2>\n<p>There should only be a small frontend change with no functional impact on how your apps and apps support APIs work. The top bar app UI in both the app session and the system icon session has been slightly modernized and made more accessible with the latest <a href=\"https://garden.zendesk.com/\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\" style=\"color: #1155cc;\">Garden</span></a> components. Functionally, everything should remain the same.</p>\n<p>If you notice any differences in how apps or the rest of the agent experience functions in your account, please let us know.</p>\n<p>There’s no action required from you. This update is automatically rolled out and available to all accounts.</p>\n<p>For more information on design recommendations and achieving a consistent look and feel, please see our <a href=\"https://developer.zendesk.com/documentation/apps/app-design-guidelines/support/topbar-apps-support/\">Top bar apps (Support) </a>guide in the Zendesk developer documentation.</p>\n<p>If you have feedback or questions related to this announcement, visit our <a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/community/topics/1260801854190-Zendesk-Apps-framework-ZAF-\">community forum</a> where we collect and manage customer product feedback.

This change inadvertently caused some published articles to be republished without user intervention, resulting in some draft versions of articles to be inadvertently published.</p>\n<h4 id=\"h_01J2ZS11SQPD7EPFGM1KH87GW6\" class=\"p1\"><strong>Timeline</strong></h4>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>July 09, 2024 08:41 PM UTC | July 09, 2024 01:41 PM PT </strong><br>Our engineers have identified the issue and rolled back the affecting change across all pods. Guide article editing, saving, and publishing have been restored to normal behavior. Please note: If you saved any article edits between 11:40 UTC to 20:37 UTC, you may have inadvertently published draft article content. You will need to manually restore the previous published version by either using the Guide article revision history feature or manually updating the article and republishing.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>July 09, 2024 07:57 PM UTC | July 09, 2024 12:57 PM PT </strong><br>We have confirmed an issue with editing published Guide articles wherein clicking \"save\" inadvertently publishes the article live instead of only \"saving\" the current article draft version. We are working on reverting a change to restore the normal behavior. We will provide another update in 30 minutes or when have new information to share.</p>\n<p class=\"undefined\"> </p>\n</div>\n<h3 id=\"h_01J2ZS347YH59FYXMAJ99QK1WM\" class=\"p1\"><strong>POST-MORTEM</strong></h3>\n<h4 id=\"h_01J2ZS1R96DJKVC3K30VNW82NS\">Root Cause Analysis</h4>\n<p>An update intended to improve our editing system inadvertently caused edits to be processed twice, once through the old system and once through the new one. This led to articles being republished unnecessarily.</p>\n<h4 id=\"h_01J2ZS1W2MDAHQX8ZCHRFXKG48\">Resolution</h4>\n<p>Upon identifying the issue, we implemented a fix to disable the problematic feature. The system was stabilized, and normal operations resumed.</p>\n<h4 id=\"h_01J2ZS1Z9WV88WKE8TG9S074W2\">Remediation Items</h4>\n<p>We have identified several steps to prevent similar incidents in the future:</p>\n<p>1. Ensure commands within our system are side-effect free.<br>2. Separate the republishing logic for different customer tiers.<br>3. Enhance our pre-deployment testing to better capture such issues.</p>\n<p>We apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused and appreciate your understanding as we strive to improve our services.</p>\n<h4 id=\"h_01J2ZS1R96QT1MA50Q0QG0X12Z\"> </h4>\n<h4 id=\"h_01J2YARY82SQ3H8PEWPR1X175Y\"><strong>FOR MORE INFORMATION</strong></h4>\n<p class=\"p1\">For current system status information about your Zendesk, check out our <a href=\"https://status.zendesk.com\">system status page</a>.

Due to this conflict, the current user who tries to log in via JWT authentication can't be authenticated.</p>\n<p>For example, this error can occur when an existing Zendesk user with an external_ID 1234 was updated and the <code>external_ID</code> of the user changed, for example 123456. Both the user in Zendesk and the payload will have the same information, same email, and same external_ID. When trying to authenticate the user however, the email registered for that user will be linked to an <code>AppUserID</code> in Sunshine Conversation. Zendesk will only allow the authentication of the user with the previous external_ID, 1234.</p>\n<p>To resolve this behaviour and allow users with an updated <code>external_ID</code> to log in via JWT authentication, you must delete the previous <code>AppUserID</code> linked to the first <code>external_ID</code>.</p>\n<p>With Suite Professional and above plans, make an API call:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Basic authentication</strong>, use an <a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4576088682266-Using-the-Conversations-API-keys#:~:text=To%20create%20and%20share%20an,Click%20Create%20API%20key.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">API key and a secret key</a>.\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Username</strong>: <code>API_KEY_ID</code>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Password</strong>: <code>API_KEY_SECRET</code>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>API method</strong>: <code>DELETE</code>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>URL for European accounts</strong>: <code>https://api.eu-1.smooch.io/v2/apps/{appId}/users/{userIdOrExternalId}</code>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>URL for the rest of the world</strong>: <code>https://api.smooch.io/v2/apps/{appId}/users/{userIdOrExternalId}</code><br>Within the above URLs, replace the <code>{appId}</code> with the ID provided when generating the API key and secret key, and replace the <code>{userIdOrExternalId}</code> with the previous <code>external_ID</code> linked to the user who returns the error.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"p\">\n<div class=\"note note\">\n<span class=\"notetitle\"><strong>Disclaimer</strong>:</span> This article is provided for instructional purposes only.

This was due to a change in our system that inadvertently caused an error, impacting the availability of these recordings. Once the issue was identified, we reverted the change, restoring normal service.</p>\n<div id=\"message-list\">\n<h4 id=\"h_01J2DR6JA2R8R1HDQ4KDEFNF1S\" class=\"undefined\"><strong>Timeline<br></strong></h4>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>July 05, 2024 01:52 PM UTC | July 05, 2024 06:52 AM PT<br></strong>Changes were successfully reverted to the previous working state. Logs indicate that our recovery process is functioning and should recover recordings within the next couple of hours. Please allow time for the system to process any previously unavailable recordings. A simple page or browser refresh/update may be required. Thank you for your patience while we worked on this.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>July 05, 2024 01:31 PM UTC | July 05, 2024 06:31 AM PT </strong><br>We are currently aware of and working on reverting recent changes that have impacted Talk customers, causing “Call recordings” to be unavailable across multiple Pods. The next update will be provided in 30 minutes.</p>\n</div>\n<h3 id=\"h_01J2CE2M72E3KBZSRKQ9AN08GW\" class=\"p1\"><strong><br>POST-MORTEM</strong></h3>\n<h4 id=\"h_01J2DR3N4321MGQB6HDZ4BPCQ7\" class=\"undefined\"><strong>Root Cause Analysis</strong></h4>\n<p class=\"undefined\">The issue was caused by a change in our system configuration that affected how call recordings were stored. Specifically, a setting was altered that directed our service to an incorrect storage location, resulting in errors when trying to save call recordings.</p>\n<h4 id=\"h_01J2DR3R7PPAJVYF5N237D1H65\"><strong>Resolution</strong></h4>\n<p>Upon identifying the issue, we quickly reverted the change that caused the problem. This rollback restored the correct configuration, and our service resumed normal operation.</p>\n<h4 id=\"h_01J2DR3V87XN0SBMBJ3HJNK8B5\"><strong>Remediation</strong></h4>\n<p>To prevent this from happening again, we are taking the following steps:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Improved Testing: We will enhance our testing processes to catch similar issues before they reach production.</li>\n<li>Configuration Management: We will update our system to use separate settings for different services, ensuring that changes to one service do not inadvertently impact another.</li>\n<li>Monitoring and Alerts: We will improve our monitoring and alerting systems to detect and respond to issues more quickly.</li>\n</ol>\n<h4 id=\"h_01J2CDA4B7BNCA6EZZPHNVQ2D2\"><strong><br>FOR MORE INFORMATION</strong></h4>\n<p class=\"p1\">For current system status information about your Zendesk, check out our <a href=\"https://status.zendesk.com\">system status page</a>.

This caused our systems to slow down, resulting in delays and temporary service interruptions. We took immediate action to manage the increased load and restore normal operations.</p>\n<h4 id=\"h_01J2DSD18VCCNM90XD0WZMBGCB\"><strong>Root Cause Analysis</strong></h4>\n<p>The main cause was a sudden traffic spike, which doubled our usual traffic and saturated our database, leading to delays. Additionally, our AnswerBot service couldn't handle the increased load, causing further disruptions.</p>\n<h4 id=\"h_01J2DSD51H30SSZ9GE3XN6QSRR\"><strong>Resolution</strong></h4>\n<p>To mitigate the issue, we scaled up our database and AnswerBot service, increasing their capacity to handle the surge. This allowed us to restore normal operations and process the backlog of messages.</p>\n<h4 id=\"h_01J2DSD8K47SZQWP2BHMBZJ30S\"><strong>Remediation Items</strong></h4>\n<p>1. Enable Auto-Scaling: Implement automatic scaling for critical services to handle sudden traffic spikes.<br>2. Introduce Circuit Breakers: Prevent overloading of services by temporarily reducing traffic when necessary.<br>3. Improve Monitoring: Enhance our monitoring systems to detect and respond to similar issues more quickly.<br><br></p>\n<h4 id=\"h_01J1W1JCEC1J8X6J4KGSB0C8SR\"><strong>FOR MORE INFORMATION</strong></h4>\n<p class=\"p1\">For current system status information about your Zendesk, check out our <a href=\"https://status.zendesk.com\">system status page</a>.
